Forty-eight teams vied.</p>\n\n<p>Cornell's adviser, Employment and Disability Institute Associate Director Thomas Golden, and eight ILR students gave the 2013-2014 team a strong ILR presence, according to Mock Trial Treasurer Christine Gabrellian '15.</p>\n\n<p>\"Having Professor Golden as our adviser has been pivotal in our expansion and marketing as a student organization on campus,\" she said. \"He has helped with our new website, marketing in the ILR School and university as a whole, and developed a platform for us to reach out to Cornell alum.\"</p>\n\n<p>This year marks the 30th anniversary of mock trial nationally. The competitive extracurricular continues to grow in popularity because it is fun for students interested in anything from law to finance to theater, Gabrellian said.</p>\n\n<p>Each university and college team is responsible for providing people in the roles of attorneys – both prosecution and defense – and their own witnesses, she said. Every August, a new fictional case is issued to teams across the country and the hard work begins. Cornell \"mockers\" spend up to eight hours a week practicing with teammates, Gabrellian said.</p>\n\n<p>Big Red mockers divided into several teams within the team to prepare and manipulate the case in their own ways, she said. At tournaments, Cornellians competed against students from other schools to see what worked, what did not and where they needed to get stronger.</p>\n\n<p>Two judges, both of whom must have been practicing attorneys or former mock trial participants, preside over the contests. Tournaments often last all weekend and can become networking opportunities for the pragmatic student; some come away with internships after making connections during a trial, Gabrellian said.</p>\n\n<p>Traveling to tournaments can pose a financial issue, Gabrellian said, but this year, the Big Red team received university funding, aid from alumni and parents, and a donation from ILR Dean Harry Katz.</p>\n\n<p>The intense work required to participate and excel as part of mock trial isn't the only thing that keeps this group close, she said. After August tryouts, students receiving offers to join the team are greeted with what mockers call a \"ding-dong bid\" – a paper invite, delivered to the individual's residence – and graduating members are presented with ropes to wear at commencement.</p>\n\n<p>Bringing extra honors to the team this year were:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Laura Bach '16, mock trial attorney and team captain, two All-American awards on defense and prosecution as a double-sided, closing attorney,</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jessica Borenstein HA '14, mock trial witness and team captain, All-American award on the prosecution for her portrayal of Tyler Hartman,</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cole DeVoy A&amp;S '18, double-sided witness, one rank from an All-American witness award on the defense.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All-American awards go to the top 20 attorneys and top 20 witnesses at each national championship tournament, Gabrellian said. Attorneys and witnesses compete for All-American awards against 6,000 individuals each season.\n<br />\n</p>",

He is chairman of the International Labor Organization’s Committee on Freedom of Association, the authoritative world body on workers’ union organizing and collective bargaining rights.\n<br />\n<br />\nCompa, in an interview, said, “Paul van der Heijden is a giant in the international human rights field and it’s a great honor to be the first person chosen for the chair in his name. It also reflects positively on the ILR School’s strength in the international and comparative labor field.”\n<br />\n<br />\nLeiden Law School Dean Lawson said, “We are very pleased to have Lance Compa joining us this fall. We decided to honor Paul van der Heijden with a special chair, since he is one of our most distinguished lawyers. In addition to his work for the ILO, he had a long career in academia. Before becoming Rector Magnificus of Leiden University, he was, amongst others, Rector Magnificus at the University of Amsterdam. We were looking for a specialist with a solid international reputation to hold the new chair, and we are delighted to have found Professor Compa.”\n<br />\n<br />\nILR’s Kenneth F. Kahn Dean Harry Katz said, “Lance Compa’s appointment as the first Leiden Law School Social Justice chair is a tribute to his scholarship and thought leadership in the international human rights field. Lance and others at ILR who teach, research and conduct outreach around the world are broadening ILR’s mission at the global level.”  \n<br />\n<br />\nAt ILR, Compa offers courses on U.S. labor and employment law, corporate social responsibility and international labor rights. In addition to dozens of scholarly articles on labor and human rights, he has written three book-length reports for Human Rights Watch on workers’ freedom of association in the United States under international human rights standards.\n<br />\n<br />\nCompa also has conducted workers' rights investigations and reports on Cambodia, Chile, China, Haiti, Guatemala, Mexico, Sri Lanka and other developing countries. He is co-author, with colleagues in the Labor Law Group, of International Labor Law: Cases and Materials on Workers’ Rights in the Global Economy, a standard law school text on the subject.\n<br />\n<br />\nCompa added, “It’s a special pleasure because Professor van der Heijden and I will co-teach a course on international labor law. This is a great opportunity to participate in the life of the law school and to engage with Leiden Law’s outstanding faculty and students, who are drawn from across the country, across Europe and across the world.”\n<br />\n<br />\nLocated in the Dutch city of Leiden, the school Compa will teach at is the top-ranked law school in continental Europe and a center of international law studies since the 17th century. It was the home of Hugo Grotius, the founder of modern international law.\n<br />\n<br />\nCompa joined the ILR faculty in 1997. After law school and before turning to international labor law practice and teaching, he worked for many years as a trade union organizer and lawyer in the U.S. labor movement.\n<br />\n<br />\nCompa received a bachelor’s degree in History from Fordham University in 1969 and his law degree from Yale Law School in 1973. He also studied abroad at the Institut d’Études Politiques in Paris, France (1967-1968), and at the Universidad de Chile in Santiago, Chile (1972-1973).\n<br />\n</p>",

    "STORY_CONTENT": "<h2>Scheinman researches how schools frame teacher rating appeal processes</h2>\n\n<p>Varying appeal procedures in the controversial performance review for teachers in New York state are examined in a <a id=\"http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/bargaining-for-better-schools/upload/APPR-Teacher-Appeals-Process-Report.pdf|\" href=\"http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/bargaining-for-better-schools/upload/APPR-Teacher-Appeals-Process-Report.pdf\">research brief</a> published by the Scheinman Institute on Conflict Resolution this month.</p>\n\n<p>The Annual Professional Performance Review (APPR) evaluation for teachers adopted by New York state in 2012 allows for dismissal – even for tenured teachers – after two consecutive ratings of \"ineffective,\" the lowest level of the four-level rating system.</p>\n\n<p>Each of the state's 696 public school districts has a locally negotiated appeals system. The Scheinman Institute report, produced through its Bargaining for Better Schools project with the Worker Institute at Cornell, quantifies how district appeals procedures statewide have been structured.</p>\n\n<p>Its findings include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tenured teachers have broad appeal rights, though in 14.3 percent of agreements, tenured teachers are only able to appeal “ineffective” (lowest level) ratings, but not \"developing\" (second lowest level) ratings;</li>\n\n<li>Non-tenured teachers have broad appeal rights in most procedures, but in 29.8 percent of procedures, they are unable to file an appeal about an improvement plan and in 35 percent of procedures, they are unable to appeal the plan's implementation process; </li>\n\n<li>Non-tenured teachers are unable to appeal an \"ineffective\" rating in 26.5 percent of procedures and unable to appeal a \"developing\" rating in 46.7 percent; </li>\n\n<li>District superintendents have the final say on appeals for tenured teachers in 77 percent of districts and, for non-tenured teachers, in 76 percent of districts; </li>\n\n<li>A panel jointly appointed by the district administration and teacher and/or union is the final decision-maker in 15 percent of appeal procedures for tenured teachers and 14 percent of procedures for non-tenured teachers; </li>\n\n<li>Arbitrators are the final decision makers, for both tenured and non-tenured teachers, in only two percent of districts; </li>\n\n<li>The mean maximum time limit for the appeals process is 64 days for tenured teachers and 63 days for non-tenured teachers.\n<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The research also compares how appeal processes interact with procedures established through teachers' contracts. Sixty-six percent of districts appeals processes do not allow use of grievance procedures spelled out in contracts to be used to appeal the teacher rating.</p>\n\n<p>In nearly 10 percent of procedures, there is a special appeal procedure for a teacher who has received back-to-back “ineffective” ratings; consecutive “ineffective” ratings lead to a hearing that can result in termination of the teacher.</p>\n\n<p>The final decision maker in the special appeal procedures is most commonly an arbitrator (64 percent of districts), followed by the superintendent (21 percent), a joint teacher-administrator panel (9 percent) and the school board (3 percent).</p>\n\n<p>Co-author Professor Alex Colvin, the ILR School's Martin F. Scheinman Professor of Conflict Resolution, said the upshot of the report is that \"appeal procedures vary substantially across districts around the state.\"</p>\n\n<p>Although tenured teachers have more rights to appeal performance reviews than non-tenured teachers, non-tenured teachers may have more rights to due process than they had before appeals processes were established through the evaluation system that began in 2012.</p>\n\n<p>\"School districts and local teacher unions have had to scramble to develop appeal procedures for the new performance review system. Our results show that they have experimented with a range of different options in designing these procedures,\" Colvin said.</p>\n\n<p>\"Going forward, our data will help inform efforts to improve these appeal procedures to the benefit of both teachers and school districts,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>More information about Bargaining for Better Schools and its research is available at <a id=\"http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/bbs|\" href=\"http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/bbs\">http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/bbs</a>.</p>",
