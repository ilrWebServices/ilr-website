    "DESCRIPTION": "\"Overthe last decade, ugly allegations of corporate complicity in human rights violations have exploded into one of the most controversial issues of our times, even inspiring massive demonstrations in Seattle at the World Trade Organization's meeting in the fall of 1999. Using the story of Levi Strauss & Company as a guide, Levi's Children offers a much-needed perspective on the challenges faced by businesses and activists alike...The company earned the praise of human rights activists for initiating a groundbreaking global code of conduct in 1991 before a national furor forced other companies to adopt similar codes. A year later, Levi Strauss was one of the first multinationals to withdraw from Burma, repudiating the repressive military junta. Yet the reversal of its China policy in 1998, five years after it said it would phase out sourcing relationships there on human rights grounds, reveals Levi's struggle to balance ethical values against profits.<br><br>\nSchoenberger takes a critical look at Levi Strauss's decisions, placing them in the larger context of the contentious human-rights debate. He is deeply sensitive to the interests and limitations of multinationals, yet he also calls on them to engage proactively in protecting the rights of citizens of foreign countries where they do business. He stresses the need for rigorous corporate transparency that honestly informs the public of business practices.\" [from the dust jacket]\n\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "The aim of this book is to \"bring together a collection of workplace studies which have different substantive concerns and reflect different approaches to understanding technology and organisational conduct. It is also concerned with raising and exploring the more applied issues which arise with workplace studies and in particular the extent to which they may contribute to the design and deployment of new technologies\" [from the preface]. The collection consists of two parts: \"part one contains a number of detailed case studies that not only provide an insight into the issues central to workplace studies but also some of the problems involved in carrying out such research. Part two focuses on the interrelationship between workplace studies and the design of new technologies.\"[from the dust jacket] (prd, 11/00)\n",

This pictorial history records the everyday lives and struggles of construction workers, longshoremen, sales clerks, garment workers, and other working-class New Yorkers. It provides a glimpse into the traditions and organizations — especially the labor unions — which provided these mostly foreign-born people with a sense of solidarity and security, both emotional and financial. Many of the photographs in this volume are drawn from the collections of the Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation and Archives in the Catherwood Library.(db, 6/00)     ",

    "DESCRIPTION": "\"Sustaining the New Economy explores the growing tension between the requirements of employers for a flexible work force and the ability of parents and communities to nurture their children and provide for their health, welfare, and education. Global competition and the spread of information technology are forcing businesses to engage in rapid, world-wide production changes, customized marketing, and just-in-time delivery. They are reorganizing work around decentralized management, work differentiation, and short-term and part-time employment. Increasingly, workers must be able to move across firms and even across types of work, as jobs get redefined. But there is a stiff price being paid for this labor market flexibility. It separates workers from the social institutions--family, long-term jobs, and stable communities--that sustained economic expansions in the past and supported the growth and development of the next generation. This is exacerbated by the continuing movement of women into paid work, which puts a greater strain on the family's ability to care for and rear children. Unless government fosters the development of new, integrative institutions to support the new world of work, the book argues, the conditions required for long-term economic growth and social stability will be threatened. It concludes by laying out a framework for creating such institutions.\" [from the dust jacket] (prd, 12/22/00) ",

He describes his difficult confirmation process and wrenching Congressional hearings, particularly the one over Proposition 226, a ballot initiative that required unions to get explicit authorization from all represented workers prior to expending dues for political purposes. He tells how the behavior of both Board members and members of Congress, guided by self-interest and rigid ideology, contributed to the Board's problems. He also recounts the positive strides the NLRB made during his tenure, despite the turmoil. The book provides an insider's view of what goes on behind the closed doors in our nation's capital, including discussions with members of Congress, the White House, and President Bill Clinton.\" [from the dust jacket]",

Taken together, these studies authoritatively outline workers' attitudes toward, and opportunities for, representation and influence in the Anglo-American workplace.

    "DESCRIPTION": "\"Workers in nineteenth-century sweatshops earned low wages and worked long hours in unsanitary and unsafe surroundings. More than a century later these same characteristics have emerged in much of the trucking industry as a result of competitive forces. Sweatshops on Wheels describes the transformation of the trucking industry from a complacent backwater into a competitive powerhouse and the effect of that transformation on truckers. The interstate trucking industry was among the first to deregulate, and it experienced some of the most extreme effects - both positive and negative - of competition. Within five years, truckers transformed themselves from broad utility service providers into niche specialists, creating many distinct service and labor markets... Michael H. Belzer, a leading expert on labor and trucking issues with first-hand experience in the industry, asks us to take a look at the dark side of competition, challenging us to reexamine current public policy trends that have replaced institutional regulation with regulation by the market.\" [from the dust jacket] (prd, 10/00)\n",

According to conventional wisdom, workers can no longer count on building a career with a single employer, and job security is a rare prize. While there is no shortage of striking anecdotes to fuel these popular beliefs, reliable evidence is harder to come by. Researchers have yet to determine whether we are witnessing a sustained, economy-wide decline in the stability of American jobs, or merely a momentary rupture confined to a few industries and a few classes of workers. <BR><BR>\n\nOn the Job launches a concerted effort to reconcile the conflicting evidence about job stability and security.

She was inspired in part by the rhetoric surrounding welfare reform, which promised that a job-any job-could be the ticket to a better life. But how does anyone survive, let alone prosper, on six or seven dollars an hour? To find out, Ehrenreich left her home, took the cheapest lodgings she could find, and accepted whatever jobs she was offered as a woefully inexperienced homemaker returning to the workforce. So began a grueling, hair-raising, and darkly funny odyssey through the underside of working America. <BR><BR>\n\nMoving from Florida to Maine to Minnesota, Ehrenreich worked as a waitress, a hotel maid, a cleaning woman, a nursing home aide, and a Wal-Mart sales clerk. Very quickly, she discoverd that no job is truly 'unskilled,' that even the lowliest occupations require exhausting mental and muscular effort.

    "DESCRIPTION": "\"Not all workers' needs were served by the union. Focusing on the steel workers at Duquesne, Pennsylvania, a linchpin of the old Carnegie Steel company empire and then of U.S. Steel, James D. Rose demonstrates the pivotal role played by a nonunion form of employee representation usually dismissed as a flimsy front for management interests. <BR><BR>\n\nThe early New Deal set in motion two versions of workplace representation that battled for supremacy: company-sponsored employee representation plans (ERPs) and independent trade unionism. At Duquesne, the cause of the unskilled, hourly workers, mostly eastern and southern Europeans as well as blacks, was take up by the union--the Fort Dukane Lodge of the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers.\nFor skilled tonnage workers and skilled tradesmen, mainly U.S.-born and of northern and western European extraction, ERPs offered a better solution...<BR><BR>\n\nA sophisticated study of the forces that shaped and responded to workers' interests, Duquesne and the Rise of Steel Unionism confirms that what people did on the shop floor was as critical to the course of steel unionism as were corporate decision making and shifts in government policy.\" [from the dust jacket]",

In After Capitalism he explores a growing trend in capitalist systems worldwide: workplace democracy. <BR><BR>\n\nThe end of the Cold War in 1991 inspired an unprecedented outburst of triumphalist rhetoric among proponents of unfettered capitalism.

    "DESCRIPTION": "\"As a firm expands or contracts in the course of its evolution--from nimble start-up to arrogant arrive to bloated conglomerate to downsized veteran of competitive struggle--it experiences predictable stages of change. During these stages, a company discovers that what worked in the past no longer works. At such times, managers have to juggle the three variables of organizational evolution--the firm's purpose, its processes and procedures, and its human resource issues--and keep them in balance as they reinvent new ways of structuring the firm. Inevitably, tension develops as one variable is stressed at the expense of the others. Managers need to know how to cede decision making without abrogating overall control of the organization. <BR><BR>\n\nThe model developed here derives from the authors' understanding of how successful firms have managed these tensions. Fletcher and Taplin deal with teamwork, leadership, and the nature of dynamic change while successfully avoiding the cliches to which many experts in those areas are prone. [from the dust jacket]",

    "DESCRIPTION": "\"The American labor market faces many deep-rooted problems, including persistence of a large low-wage sector, worsening inequality in earnings, employees'lack of a voice in the workplace, and the need of employers to maximize flexibility if they are to survive in an increasingly competitive market. The impetus for this book is the absence of a serious national debate about these issues. <BR><BR>\n\nThe book represents nearly three years of deliberation by more than 250 people drawn from business, labor, community groups, academia, and government. It traces today's labor-market policy and laws back to the New Deal and to a second wave of social regulation that began in the 1960s. Underlying the current system are assumptions about who is working, what workers do, and how much job security workers enjoy. Economic and social change have rendered those assumptions invalid and and have resulted in mismatches between labor institutions and efficient and equitable deployment of the work force, as well as between commitments to the labor market and family responsibilities. This book should launch a national dialogue on how to update our policies and institutions to catch up with the changes in the nature of work, in the work force, and in the economy.\" [from the dust jacket]",

Yet conventional wisdom--born of the stagflation of the 1970s--holds that sustained low unemployment rates run the risk of triggering inflation. The last five years of the 1990s--in which unemployment plummeted and inflation remained low--called this conventional wisdom into question. The Roaring Nineties provides a thorough review of the exceptional economic performance of the late 1990s and asks whether the new economy has somehow wrought a lasting change in the inflation-safe rate of unemployment.\" [from the dust jacket]",

Is this institutional immensity the logical outcome of technological forces in an all-efficient market, as some have argued?

He shows that there was nothing inevitable about the surge in corporate size and power by century's end.

Many workers communicate regularly with distant coworkers; some monitor and manipulate tools and objects at a distance. Work teams are spread across different cities or countries. Joint ventures and multiorganizational projects entail work in many locations. Two famous examples--the Hudson's Bay Company's seventeenth-century fur trading empire and the electronic community that created the original Linux computer operating system--suggest that distributed work arrangements can be flexible, innovative, and highly successful. At the same time, distributed work complicates workers' professional and personal lives. Distributed work alters how people communicate and how they organize themselves and their work, and it changes the nature of employee-employer relationships. <BR><BR>\n\nThis book takes a multidisciplinary approach to the study of distributed work groups and ogranizations, the challenges inherent in distributed work, and ways to make distributed work more effective.\" [from the dust jacket]",

Many cannot find jobs, and those who do are often stuck in low-wage, dead-end positions. Meanwhile employers complain that high school graduates lack the necessary skills for today's workplace. Beyond College for All focuses on this crisis in the American labor market. Around the world, author James E. Rosenbaum finds, employers view high school graduates as valuable workers. Why not here? <BR><BR>\n\nRosenbaum reports on new studies of the interaction between employers and high schools in the United States. He concludes that each fails to communicate its needs to the other, leading to a predictable array of problems for young people in the years after graduation. High schools caught up in the college-for-all myth, provide little job advice or preparation, leading students to make unrealistic plans and hampering both students who do not go to college and those who start college and do not finish. Employers say they care about academic skills, but then do not consider grades when deciding who to hire. Faced with few incentives to achieve, many students lapse into precisely the kinds of habits employers deplore, doing as little as possible in high school and developing poor attitudes.\" [from the dust jacket]",

    "DESCRIPTION": "\"Moe Foner, who died in January 2002, was a leading player in 1199/SEIU, New York's Health and Human Service Union, and a key strategist in the union's fight for recognition and higher wages for thousands of low-paid hospital workers. Foner also was the founder of Bread and Roses, 1199's cultural program created to add dimension and artistic outlets to workers' lives. <BR><BR>\n\nNot for Bread Alone traces Foner's development from an apolitical youth whose main concerns were basketball and music to a visionary whose pragmatism paved the way for legislation guaranteeing hospital workers the right to unionize. Foner writes eloquently about his early life in Brooklyn as the son of a seltzer delivery man and about many of the critical developments in the organization of hospital workers. He provides an insider's perspective on major strikes and the struggle for statewide collective bargaining; the leadership styles of Leon Davis, Doris Turner, and Dennis Rivera; and the union's connection to key events such as the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War.\" [from the dust jacket]",

    "DESCRIPTION": "\"From the earliest days of industrialization to the Company Man of the 1950s, work has long been a source of meaning and identity as well as a source of income. But at the end of the twentieth century, the digital companies of the New Economy promised both. These businesses offered employees creative challenges, freedoms, and an office environment that welcomed leisure and play. An entirely new kind of industrial personality emerged, feeding off the non-conformist work mentality of the hi-tech industries and the creativity of urban bohemia. But was it 'as good as it gets in corporate America,' as some employers and employees said? Or did this humane workplace carry too many hidden costs? <BR><BR>\n\nThe hype concealed a lifestyle in which the line between work time and personal time was blurred beyond hope, and an office where the lowest level employee was as stressed out as the highest-level leader. Far from delivering a promised employment nirvana, the new structure simply created new worries for employees...Features that appeared to be healthy advances in corporate democracy turned into trapdoors that opened on to a bottomless 70-hour plus workweek. For the no-collar worker, every free thought and creative impulse could be enlisted in the service of salaried time. No-Collar is the first book to shine a full light on the realities of this modern workplace--both myth and reality.\" [from the dust jacket]",

    "DESCRIPTION": "\"Major changes within and between organizations are now generally negotiated by the parties that have a stake in the consequences of the changes. This was not always so. In 1965, with A Behavioral Theory of Labor Negotiations, Richard Walton and Robert McKersie laid the analytical foundation for much of the innovation in the practice of negotiation that has occurred over the last thirty-seven years. Since that time, however, the field has undergone significant changes, and Walton and McKersie's ideas have been applied to a wide variety of situations beyond labor negotiations. <BR><BR>\n\nNegotiations and Change represents the next generation of thinking. Experts on negotiations, management, and organizational behavior take stock of what has been learned since 1965. They extend and apply the concepts of Walton and McKersie and of other leaders in the study of negotiations to a broad range of business, professional, and personal concerns: workplace teams, conflict management systems, corporate governance, and environmental disputes. While building on those foundations, the essays demonstrate the continued robustness and relevance of Walton and McKersie's behavioral theory by suggesting ways it could be used to improve the management of change.\" [from the dust jacket]",

A generation ago, there were few workers over the age of 65, but in the future we will see many more employees remain on the job longer than ever before. At the same time, as global markets grow more closely integrated, companies are having to reinvent the workplace, which requires more skilled, more reliable, and more flexible employees. Benefits for the Workplace of the Future explores how workforce and workplace changes are reshaping the form and design of employee benefits and what these trends portend for the future of compensation.\" [from the dust jacket]",

    "DESCRIPTION": "\"Managing conflict effectively has become a nearly universal concern. In this book, we discuss the ongoing search for better methods of managing and resolving workplace conflict. In Part One, we describe how dissatisfaction with traditional methods of resolving workplace disputes, such as litigation, has caused many U.S. employers to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR), especially mediation and arbitration. We discuss why the use of workplace ADR led some employers to develop workplace conflict management systems--to move beyond ADR to a more holistic, proactive approach. Analyzing the forces and factors at work in this move away from traditional techniques and toward a systems approach is the central concern of Part One. <BR><BR>\n\nIn Part Two, we move from the \"what\" and \"why\" of conflict management systems to the \"how.\" We describe how corporations and other organizations design, implement, and evaluate workplace conflict management systems...<BR><BR>\n\nIn Part Three, we consider the future of workplace conflict resolution. We focus first on the barriers to the growth of these systems and then on why we think these barriers will be overcome and the growth of systems will continue to occur.\" [from the Preface]",

Job ladders for workers who lack a college degree have been dismantled, limiting their ability to get ahead in today's labor Market. Low-Wage America is the most extensive study to date of how the choices employers make in response to economic globalization, industry deregulation, and advances in information technology affect the lives of tens of millions of workers at the bottom of the wage distribution.\n\nBased on data from hundreds of establishments in twenty-five industries--including manufacturing, telecommunications, hospitality, and health care--the case studies document how firms' responses to economic restructuring often result in harsh working conditions, reduced benefits, and fewer opportunities for advancement. For instance, increased pressurefor profits in newly consolidated hotel chains has led to cost-cutting strategies such as requiring maids to increase the\nnumber of rooms they clean by 50 percent...\n\nAlthough employers' responses to economic pressures have generally had a negative effect on frontline workers, some\nemployers manage to resist this trend and still compete successfully...Low-Wage America challenges us to a national\nself-examination about the nature of low-wage work in this country and asks whether we are willing to tolerate the profound social and economic consequences entailed by these jobs.\"  [from the dust jacket]",

The traditional narrow focus on efficiency must be balanced with employees' entitlement to fair treatment (equity) and the opportunity to have meaningful input into decisions (voice), he says.

At greatest risk are jobs that can\nbe expressed in programmable rules--blue collar, clerical, and similar work that requires moderate skills and used to\npay middle-class wages. The loss of these jobs leaves a growing division between those who can and cannot earn a\ngood living. Left unchecked, the division threatens the nation's democratic institutions.\n\nThe nation's challenge is to recognize this division and to prepare the population for the high-wage / high-skilled jobs\nthat are rapidly growing in number--jobs involving extensive problem solving and interpersonal communication.\" [from the dust jacket]",

    "DESCRIPTION": "\"Why have Americans, who by a clear majority approve of unions, been joining them in smaller numbers than ever\nbefore? This book answers that question by comparing the American experience with that of Canada, where approval\nfor unions is significantly lower than in the United States, but where since the mid-1960s workers have joined organized labor to a much greater extent. Given that the two countries are outwardly so similar, what explains this paradox? This book provides a detailed comparative analysis of both countries using, among other things, a survey conducted in the United States and Canada by the Ipsos-Reid polling group.\" [from the dust jacket]",

Although commentators have focused largely on low-wage temporary work, the use of skilled contractors has also grown exponentially, especially in high-technology areas. Yet, almost nothing is known about contracting or about the people who do it. <BR>\n\n<I>Gurus, Hired Guns and Warm Bodies</I> tells the story of how the market for temporary professionals operates from the perspective of the contractors who do the work, the managers who employ them, the permanent employees who work beside them, and the staffing agencies who broker deals. \n<BR>\n...based on a year of field work in three staffing agencies, life histories with over seventy contractors and studies of workers in some of America's best known firms.

    "DESCRIPTION": "Ricardo Semier's favorite question is \"Why?\" Why do people routinely bring work home on the weekends but never go to the movies on a Monday afternoon? Why do we need to sit at the same desk every day? Why do we have to fill out time sheets or need an HR department to file them? Whey are we interviewed by our bosses but never get to interview someone who wants to be our boss?\n\nFor the last twenty years Semier has been doing a lot more than asking questions - he's actually been running a company by breaking every tenet in the traditional rule book. Semier encourages his employees to play hooky. He tells them not to bother with growth plans. Employees choose their own salaries, set their own hours, and have no job titles.\n\nRidiculous? Inefficient?  A recipe for chaos? Perhaps. But Semier's ideas work. They work so well, in fact, that his company, Semco, has grown from $35 million in revenue to $212 million in the last six years, and even with more than 3,000 employees, it has virtually no turnover. People come from around the world to study Semier's radical management practices. [from dust jacket]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "The person calling it quits may be an expert NASA scientist, a veteran DuPont salesperson, or a senior executive who has helped build a multibillion-dollar company or government agency. Whatever the scenario, an unprecedented number of highly skilled professionals and managers will be leaving their jobs in the next few years as aging baby boomers begin retiring from the workforce in droves. The disappearance of this intellectual capital will make it very difficult for many outfits to sustain past performance levels.\n\nThis book shows how losing human knowledge in a technology-intensive era can seriously affect organizational performance. It also explains what executives can do to retain critical know-how as veteran workers leave. Loaded with anecdotes and case examples, Lost Knowledge: Confronting the Threat of an Aging Workforce provides a comprehensive framework to help managers improve the retention of vital knowledge both from older workers who retire and mid-career employees who leave unexpectedly.

    "DESCRIPTION": "The last half-century has witnessed dramatic declines in gender inequality, evidenced by the rise of egalitarian views on gender roles and the narrowing of long-standing gender gaps in university attendance and labor force participation. These developments, while spectacular, have been coupled with similarly impressive forms of resistance to equalization, most notably the continuing tendency for women to crowd into female \"occupational ghettos.\" Why has such extreme segregation persisted even as other types of gender inequality have lessened? Why is segregation especially extreme in precisely those countries that appear most committed to egalitarian reform and family-friendly policies?\n\nThe authors address these questions by developing a new archive of cross-national data and applying new models and methods of analysis to this archive. The results indicate that two deep structures underlie occupational segregation: a horizontal dynamic that allocates men into the manual sector and women into the nonmanual sector, and a vertical dynamic that allocates men to the most desirable occupations.\n[from dust jacket]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Founded during World War II, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, was a vital link in the U.S. military's atomic bomb assembly line-the site where scientists worked at a breakneck pace to turn tons of uranium into a few grams of the artificial element plutonium. To construct and operate the plants needed for this effort, thousands of workers, skilled and unskilled, converged on the \"city behind a fence\" tucked between two ridges of sparsely populated farmland in the Tennessee hills.\n\nAt Work in the Atomic City explores the world of those workers and their efforts to form unions, create a community, and gain political rights over their city. It follows them from their arrival at Oak Ridge, to the places where they lived, and to their experiences in a dangerous and secretive workplace. Lured by promises of housing, plentiful work, and schooling for their children, they were often exposed to dangerous levels of radioactivity, harmful chemicals, and other hazards. After the war, as the military sought to reduce services and jobs in Oak Ridge, workers organized unions at two plants to demand higher wages and job security. However, the new Taft-Hartley Act limited defense workers' ability to strike and thus curbed union influence.\n\nThe book examines the ongoing debates over workers' rights at Oak Ridge-notably the controversy surrounding the new federal program intended to compensate workers and their families for injuries sustained on the job. \n\nDrawing on extensive research into the oral history collections, transcripts of government proceedings, and other primary sources, At Work in the Atomic City is the first detailed account of the workers who built and labored in the facilities that helped ensure the success of the Manhattan Project.\n\n [from dust jacket]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "There are few American lives more powerful or more moving than that of C.L. Franklin. Born in rural Mississippi in 1915, he would go on to become the most famous African American preacher in America. His style of preaching revolutionized the art, and his call for his fellow African Americans to proclaim both their faith and their rights helped usher in the civil rights movement. Booming, soaring, flashy, and intense, C.L. was one of a kind. And yet Franklin was, like many great public figures, immensely complicated.\n\nSalvatore's book is the product of eight years of extensive research and interviews. This is, in many ways, the story of activism in the black church, but it is also the exhilarating tale of the rise of gospel, blues, and soul music in the twentieth century. [from dust jacket]\n",

Here, those few women who have made it to the top--about 1% of the chiefs and sheriffs in American policing--share their stories and describe the challenges they faced as they rose to their positions. Each of the chiefs competed for their offices with other candidates, almost always male. The sheriffs--virtually all elected officials--faced other challenges and came under even closer scrutiny. While few in number, these \"top cops\" illustrate the emergence of women as more than token leaders of American sheriff and police departments. They are unique groundbreakers who have managed to breach the brass ceiling.\n[from dust jacket]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "This book focuses on the lives, struggles, and contrasting perspectives of the 60,000 workers, military administrators, and technical staff employed in the largest, most strategic industry of the Nationalist government, the armaments industry based in the wartime capital, Chongqing. The author argues that China's arsenal workers participated in three interlocked conflicts between 1937 and 1953; a war of national liberation, a civil war, and a class war.\n\nThe work adds to the scholarship on the Chinese revolution, which has previously focused primarily on rural China, showing how workers' alienation from the military officers directing the arsenals eroded the legitimacy of the Nationalist regime and how the Communists mobilized working-class support in Chongqing. Moreover, in emphasizing the urban, working-class, and nationalist components of the 1949 revolution, the author demonstrates the multiple sources of workers' identities and thus challenges previous studies that have exclusively stressed workers particularistic or regional identities.

Interspersing detailed narratives of Japanese labor history with analyses of parallel developments in Western European and international labor movements, Lonny Carlile shows how world views and labor movement strategies were shared across national boundaries and shaped in similar ways in the industrialized West and East. Beyond this, he highlights how in both Western Europe and Japan issues that had divided labor since the 1920s were central to the Cold War, which kept labor movements at odds with themselves internally in systematically similar ways. His book suggests that, to the extent that the historical courses of labor movements diverged, this was as much a product of differences in geopolitical location as any inherent cultural or nationally specific ideological tendency.

Today the garment industry is one of the largest immigrant employers in New York City and workers in Chinese and Korean-owned factories produce 70 percent of all manufactured clothing in New York City. Based on extensive interviews with workers and employers, Margaret M. Chin, offers a detailed and complex portrait of the work lives of Chinese and Latino garment workers. Chin, whose mother and aunts worked in Chinatown's garment industry, also explores how immigration status, family circumstances, ethnic relations, and gender affect the garment industry workplace. In turn, she analyzes how these factors affect whom employers hire and what wages and benefits are given to the employees. \n[from dust jacket]\n",

A \"character\" in the truest sense of the word, Dubinsky was both revered and reviled, but never dull, conformist, or bound by convention. A Jewish labor radical, Dubinsky fled czarist Poland in 1910 and began his career as a garment worker and union agitator in New York City. He quickly rose through the ranks of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) and became its president in 1932. Dubinsky led the ILGWU for thirty-four years, where he championed \"social unionism,\" which offered workers benefits ranging from health care to housing. Moving beyond the realm of the ILGWU, Dubinsky also played a leading role in the American Federation of Labor (AFL), particularly during World War II. A staunch anti-communist, Dubinsky worked tirelessly to rid the American labor movement of communists and fellow-travelers.<BR>\nRobert D. Parmet also chronicles Dubinsky's influential role in local, national, and international politics. An extraordinary personality whose life and times present a fascinating lens into the American labor movement, Dubinsky leaps off the pages of this meticulously researched and vividly detailed biography.\n [from dust jacket]\n",

Millions of dollars are invested each year by companies with the expectation that new buildings and major renovations will help transform their culture, spark innovation, and herald new work patterns that strengthen performance while reducing costs.

Offices at Work addresses the fundamental design issues that organizational leaders confront such as:<br> <p>\n\n        How do we create a low-cost flexible environment that motivates employees and stimulates learning? <br>\n\tIs it worth our spending the time, money, and effort to consolidate our disparate buildings into a new corporate campus? <br>\n\tHow else can we address status concerns besides giving people offices?<br><p> \nUsing real world examples presented in a friendly and accessible style, Becker provides a broad range of insights and practical explanations for why different solutions work and make sense.

    "DESCRIPTION": "During its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, the Bethlehem Steel mill at Sparrows Point near Baltimore was one of the world's largest steel plants, employing as many as 30,000 workers. But these glory years were short-lived as the American steel industry soon collapsed, taking with it the high-income industrial jobs that many Sparrows Point workers had come to enjoy. This familiar tale of decline in America's industrial heartland is only part of the story, however. In response to downsizing and job loss at Sparrows Point, many women entered the workforce to fulfill the needs of their families living in the adjacent communities of Turners Station and Dundalk. Wives of Steel tells the story of these women who broke traditional gender roles and, in the process, contributed to the economic survival of their communities.<P>\n\nWives of Steel is based on more than eighty formal interviews conducted over a fifteen-year period with women and some men, both white and black, all of whom were part of Sparrows Point as workers, spouses, or longtime residents of the local communities. Through the stories they tell, we see how a male-dominated industry has influenced personal, family, and social experiences over several generations. We also see the distinct differences and surprising similarities between the lives of black and white women, which often reflect the complicated relationships among black and white steelworkers in the plant.\n [from dust jacket]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Barbara Ehrenreich's Nickel and Dimed explored the lives of low-wage workers. Now, in Bait and Switch, she enters another hidden realm of the economy: the shadowy world of the white-collar unemployed. Armed with a plausible résumé of a professional \"in transition,\" she attempts to land a middle-class job-undergoing career coaching and personality testing, then trawling a series of EST-like boot camps, job fairs, networking events, and evangelical job-search ministries. She gets an image makeover, works to project a winning attitude, yet is proselytized, scammed, lectured, and-again and again-rejected. <BR>\nBait and Switch highlights the people who've done everything right-gotten college degrees, developed marketable skills, and built up impressive résumés-yet have become repeatedly vulnerable to financial disaster, and not simply due to the vagaries of the business cycle. Today's ultra-lean corporations take pride in shedding their \"surplus\" employees-plunging them, for months or years at a stretch, into the twilight zone of white-collar unemployment, where job searching becomes a full-time job in itself. As Ehrenreich discovers, there are few social supports for these newly disposable workers-and little security even for those who have jobs.\n[from dust jacket]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "For nearly a century, the Bunker Hill Company was one of the premier mining and smelting corporations in the United States. Located in Kellogg, Idaho, in the remote Coeur d'Alene region, Bunker Hill played a key role in the nation's industrial development. But at the same time it was the catalyst for unprecedented labor strife and environmental desecration. And today it is of one of the EPA's largest Superfund sites. In this richly detailed history, Katherine G. Aiken traces Bunker Hill's evolution from the discovery of the mine in 1885 to the company's closure in 1981. <BR>\nThroughout the company's long history, Bunker Hill management was relentless in its pursuit of profit. But success came at a price. Each time managers sought production increases, workers became restless and dissatisfied. The resulting labor-management conflicts were nothing short of legendary. <BR>\nThe history of Bunker Hill is also very much the story of the people who lived in Idaho's Silver Valley and worked for the company. Oftentimes a tale of strife, Bunker Hill's history is at the same time a story of cooperation, dedication, and ingenuity. <BR>\nFollowing closure of Bunker Hill, the company records were placed in the University of Idaho Library Special Collections. Rarely has such a complete corporate record been available for research. Taking full advantage of this resource, Aiken offers an in-depth profile that illustrates major trends in American corporate culture.\n[from dust jacket]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Career-ladder strategies create opportunities for low-wage workers to learn new skills and advance through a progression of higher-skilled and better-paid jobs. For example, nurses' aides can become licensed practical nurses, administrative assistants can become information technology workers, and bank tellers can become loan officers. <BR>\n\nCareer-ladder programs could provide opportunities for upward mobility and also stave off impending national shortages of skilled workers. But there are a variety of obstacles that must be faced candidly if career-ladder programs are to succeed. In Moving Up in the New Economy, Joan Fitzgerald explores specific programs in different sectors of the economy--health care, child care, education, manufacturing, and biotechnology--to offer a comprehensive analysis of this innovative approach to job training. Addressing the successes achieved--and the problems faced--by career-ladder programs, this timely book will be of interest to anyone interested in career development, workforce training, and employment issues, especially those that affect low-wage workers.\n[from dust jacket]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "For decades now, human resources professionals have sounded the drumbeat of change: HR must transform itself from an administrative function into a strategic business partner. But it has been said so often, for so long, and with so little concrete, real-life information on how to actually achieve this new mission, that the message often sounds like a wouldn't-it-be-nice scenario. <BR>\nBut it isn't. More and more traditional HR activities are being farmed out to service centers, external vendors, and line managers. The work of HR is changing, and more and more professionals realize that to succeed in the future they must be part of the team that makes important business decisions. <BR>\nRoadmap to Strategic HR is a sorely needed prescription for achieving strategic focus in complex organizations. Drawn from the author's more than 25 years of experience and insights as an HR practitioner at Hallmark and other companies, the book outlines a 10-step, results-oriented plan for making the transition. It helps you integrate top-quality tactical work with innovative internal systems, talent systems, training systems, reward systems, or work processes, that will meet the strategic business demands of your organization.

    "DESCRIPTION": "Children throughout the world are engaged in a great number of activities classifiable as work. These range from relatively harmless, even laudable, activities like helping parents in their domestic chores, to morally and physically dangerous ones like soldiering and prostitution. If we leave out the former, we are left with what are generally called \"economic\" activities. The absolute number of children estimated to be engaged in the latter is, however, a stunning 8.4 million.<BR>\nShould we only be concerned about the worst forms of child labor? Most forms of child labor other than the worst ones have valuable learning-by-doing elements. Furthermore, child labor produces current income. If the family is credit rationed, child labor relaxes the liquidity constraint and increases current consumption. There is thus a trade-off between present and future consumption. To the extent that current consumption has a positive effect on future health (hence, on the child's future earning capacity and, more generally, utility), this trade-off may be lower than one might think.<BR>This book provides a blend of theory, empirical analysis and policy discussion. The authors develop a comprehensive theory of child labor, and related variables such as fertility, and infant mortality. The effects of trade are considered and country studies are included to illustrate and test different aspects of the theory in different geographical contexts.\n[from dust jacket]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Contrary to general belief, and to Japan's own self-image, inequality of income and wealth distribution in Japan has grown in the past two decades. In this well-written and accessible book, Toshiaki Tachibanaki analyzes the movement toward more income inequality in Japan and offers policy recommendations to counter the trend. Tachibanaki, Japan's leading expert on income distribution, draws on new statistical data covering wealth, inheritance, farm and business holdings, salary, and other relevant factors, to demonstrate that Japan can no longer be thought of as a \"90 percent middle-class society.\" <BR>\nThe book, updated and substantially expanded from Tachibanaki's 1998 Japanese bestseller, discusses the history and the causes of Japan's increasing income inequality and analyzes the effect on wealth distribution of intergenerational transfer. Employing cross-national comparisons to the United States and Europe throughout, Confronting Income Inequality in Japan examines the contrast between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome, evaluates equality of opportunity in terms of education and occupation, analyzes the relationship between income distribution and income growth, discusses the role of hierarchical positions in organizations, and considers the differences between welfare states and non-welfare states. Concluding with policy recommendations, Tachibanaki argues against the belief of some economists that greater inequality is unavoidable if Japan is to achieve a strong economic recovery.\n[from dust jacket]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "In the middle decades of the twentieth century, Hawai'i changed rapidly from a conservative oligarchy firmly controlled by a Euro-American elite to arguably the most progressive part of the United States. Spearheading the shift, tens of thousands of sugar, pineapple, and longshore workers eagerly joined the left-led International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU) and challenged their powerful employers. <BR>\nIn this theoretically innovative study, Moon-Kie Jung explains how Filipinos, Japanese, Portuguese, and others overcame entrenched racial divisions and successfully mobilized a mass working-class movement. He overturns the unquestioned assumption that this interracial effort traded racial politics for class politics. Instead, he shows how the movement \"reworked race\" by developing an ideology of class that incorporated and rearticulated racial meanings and practices. <BR>\nExamining a wide range of sources, Jung delves into the chronically misunderstood prewar racisms and their imperial context, the \"Big Five\" corporations' concerted attempts to thwart unionization, the emergence of the ILWU, the role of the state, and the impact of World War II. Through its historical analysis, Reworking Race calls for a radical rethinking of interracial politics in theory and practice.\n[from dust jacket]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "The last 100 years have seen a substantial reduction in the number of work-related deaths and injuries, at least in industrialized nations. Nevertheless, fatalities and injuries on the job still occur at unacceptably high rates in both industrial and developing countries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that there were 4.9 million reported workplace injuries in the U.S. in 2001. The direct and indirect economic cost of these injuries is staggering. <BR><br>\nDespite the importance of the issue, psychologists have not played a major part in studying workplace safety. This is surprising, because the theoretical and methodological traditions of psychology have much to offer in terms of understanding the causes and prevention of occupational injuries. <BR><br>\nThe psychologists contributing to this volume aim to correct the situation by analyzing both the behaviors that lead to accidental injuries in the workplace and the behaviors that can prevent and manage them. In the process, the contributors summarize what is known and not known about the subject, and raise interesting questions for researchers to answer in the future. While our knowledge is incomplete, it is clear that job-related injuries are related to poor worker-employer collaboration, lack of safety management systems, poor safety culture, deficient knowledge and training, and lack of incentive-based compensation systems. This volume points out the wide variety of ways in which I/O psychologists can help reduce unintentional workplace injuries. It will be a valuable addition to the library of psychologists and policymakers interested in job safety issues. [from dust jacket]\n",

One of the sons was Gerd Korman, whose memoir Nightmare's Fairy Tale follows his own path-from the family's deportation from Hamburg, through his time with and Anglican family in rural England, to the family's reunited life in New York City's Jewish neighborhoods.<BR><BR>\nKorman's story is at once a classic account of American immigration and uniquely Jewish tale of trauma, anxiety, and familial separation during and after the Holocaust.

Displaced from home and family, and relying on the kindness of Christian and Jewish organizations and individuals, these children could never fully belong in new wartime surroundings. Even after Korman and his brother were finally reunited with both their parents in New York, their lives remained charged by ethnic tensions and by political conflict within the American Jewish community.<BR><BR>\nBut youth was not entirely stamped out: Korman vividly recounts his life in New York as something close to a typical soccer-loving teenager.

    "DESCRIPTION": "Now that the welfare system has been largely dismantled, the fate of America's poor depends on what happens to them in the low-wage labor market. In this timely volume, Katherine S. Newman explores whether the poorest workers and families benefited from the tight labor markets and good economic times of the late 1990s. Following black and Latino workers in Harlem, who began their work lives flipping burgers, she finds more good news than we might have expected coming out of a high-poverty neighborhood. Many adult workers returned to school and obtained trade certificates, high school diplomas, and college degrees. Their persistence paid off in the form of better jobs, higher pay, and greater self-respect. Others found union jobs and, as a result, brought home bigger paychecks, health insurance, and a pension. More than 20 percent of those profiled in <I>Chutes and Ladders</I> are no longer poor.<BR><BR> \n\nA very different story emerges among those who floundered even in a good economy. Weighed down by family obligations or troubled partners and hindered by poor training and prejudice, these \"low riders\" moved in and out of the labor market, on and off public assistance, and continued to depend upon the kindness of family and friends. <BR><BR>\n\nSupplementing finely drawn ethnographic portraits, Newman examines the national picture to show that patterns around the country paralleled the findings from some of New York's most depressed neighborhoods. More than a story of the shifting fortunes of the labor market, Chutes and Ladders asks probing questions about the motivations of low-wage workers, the dreams they have for the future, and their understanding of the rules of the game.

    "DESCRIPTION": "Nothing typifies Generation X more than career dissatisfaction. Gen X women are especially frustrated. Successors to a generation of feminists who fought for equal opportunity, these young women expected to reap the benefits of their mothers’ struggles—only to find that not much has changed. Disillusioned, many have chosen to leave the professional workforce. If this \"opt out\" trend continues, the corporate world will lose an invaluable pool of talent, just when retiring Boomers will trigger a labor shortfall. Worse, Gen Xers will lose the chance to take their place as tomorrow’s leaders. <BR><BR>\n\nIn this perceptive study, Charlotte and Laura Shelton, a Boomer mother and Gen X daughter, examine the roots of this frustration—in part, the feminist revolution—and what it will take to change frustration to transformation. In the first half of the book, the authors use surveys with more than 1,200 Gen Xers and interviews with many others to create a multidimensional portrait of this generation at work. Personal stories are interwoven with analysis to reveal how Gen Xers experience work, how Boomer workplace attitudes clash with Xer expectations, and how men and women differ in what they want from their careers. <BR><BR>\n\nThe second half of the book is a call to action, encouraging Gen X women to carry on the revolution their mothers started. A four-point plan shows Gen Xers how to change from victims to activists and take charge of creating a satisfying work environment. Examples of successful X-friendly companies demonstrate how Boomer employers can attract and retain Xer talent. Finally, the authors discuss seven quantum life skills offering both generations an opportunity for personal growth. The NeXt Revolution will benefit Xers and Boomers of both genders and the corporate world they share as it leads to a new understanding of the meaning of work and workplace possibilities.

    "DESCRIPTION": "Kris Paap worked for nearly three years as a carpenter’s apprentice on a variety of jobsites, closely observing her colleagues’ habits, expressions, and attitudes. As a woman in an overwhelmingly male—and stereotypically “macho”—profession, Paap uses her experiences to reveal the ways that gender, class, and race interact in the construction industry. She shows how the stereotypes of construction workers and their overt displays of sexism, racism, physical strength, and homophobia are not “just how they are,” but rather culturally and structurally mandated enactments of what it means to be a man—and a worker—in America.<BR><BR>\nThe significance of these worker performances is particularly clear in relation to occupational safety: when the pressures for demonstrating physical masculinity are combined with a lack of protection from firing, workers are forced to ignore safety procedures in order to prove—whether male or female—that they are “man enough” to do the job. Thus these mandated performances have real, and sometimes deadly, consequences for individuals, the entire working class, and the strength of the union movement. <BR><BR>\n\nPaap concludes that machismo separates the white male construction workers from their natural political allies, increases their risks on the job, plays to management’s interests, lowers their overall social status, and undercuts the effectiveness of their union.\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Labor in the New Urban Battlegrounds examines a diverse array of innovative strategies for revitalizing the labor movement by forming alliances outside the workplace with a variety of community groups, social movements, and faith-based organizations, particularly those that address civil rights, immigrant rights, and consumer concerns. This book presents case studies of issues—such as living wages, community development corporations, and local politics—around which urban coalitions are built in “union towns” (New York City, Boston, Buffalo, and Seattle), “frontier cities” (Los Angeles, Miami, San Jose, and Nashville), and European cities (London, Frankfurt, and Hamburg). <BR><BR>\n\nIntroducing the role of urban social context in the field of labor revitalization, the editors have chosen cases with different outcomes—cities in which strong coalitions have enabled new union influence are contrasted with those in which such coalition building has been thwarted. As they survey the successes and failures of the new urban labor movement, the editors and contributors conclude that actor choice, strategic innovation, coalition building, and the urban context of labor organizing are key elements in the revitalization of the labor movement and the renewal of democracy. This book will allow the labor leaders of the future to learn from the recent experiences of their peers throughout the United States and Europe.\n",

There is also a continuous increase in the levels of globalization and internationalization of business. Over the last few decades, countries in the Middle East (mainly due to their petroleum resources) have attracted significant amounts of foreign direct investment. With the increase in globalization, both academics and practitioners are interested in learning about the nature of HRM systems prevalent in the region. Considering such facts, this book presents the HRM scenario in a number of countries in the Middle East. It aims to highlight the growth of personnel/HR function in these countries, their dominant HRM system(s), along with the influence of different factors on their HRM and the challenges faced by HR functions in these nations.\n[from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Women now comprise the majority of the working class. Yet this fundamental transformation has gone largely unnoticed. This book is about how the sex of workers matters in understanding the jobs they do, the problems they face at work, and the new labor movements they are creating in the United States and globally. In The Sex of Class, twenty prominent scholars, labor leaders, and policy analysts look at the implication of this \"sexual revolution\" for labor policy and practice. In clear, crisp prose, The Sex of Class introduces readers to some of the most vibrant and forward-thinking social movements of our era: the clerical worker protests of the 1970s; the emergence of gay rights on the auto shop floor; the upsurge of union organizing in service jobs; worker centers and community unions of immigrant women; successful campaigns for paid family leave and work redesign; and innovative labor NGOs, cross-border alliances, and global labor federations. The Sex of Class reveals the animating ideas and the innovative strategies put into practice by the female leaders of the twenty-first-century social justice movement. The contributors to this book offer new ideas for how government can help reduce class and sex inequalities; they assess the status of women and sexual minorities within the traditional labor movement; and they provide inspiring case studies of how women workers and their allies are inventing new forms of worker representation and power.

As it has throughout its history, trade unionism has demonstrated a capacity to adapt, to make its voice heard, to reassert its power.

This book is an essential resource for anyone wishing to know about contemporary labour issues. It offers a comprehensive introduction to the state of trade unionism in the world today, and the often innovative strategies and tactics trade unionists are using to revive their organisations in each of the major nations of the world. Leading labour scholars discuss, in clear prose, the health of the trade union movement, the present political and economic climate for trade union advancement, the dominant revitalisation strategies, and future prospects in each nation.

    "DESCRIPTION": "As the world economy becomes increasingly integrated, companies can shift production to wherever wages are lowest and unions weakest. How can workers defend their rights in an era of mobile capital? With national governments forced to compete for foreign investment by rolling back legal protections for workers, fair trade advocates are enlisting consumers to put market pressure on companies to treat their workers fairly. In Beyond the Boycott, sociologist Gay Seidman asks whether this non-governmental approach can reverse the “race to the bottom” in global labor standards.<br><br>\n\nBeyond the Boycott examines three campaigns in which activists successfully used the threat of a consumer boycott to pressure companies to accept voluntary codes of conduct and independent monitoring of  work sites:  The voluntary Sullivan Code required American corporations operating in apartheid-era South Africa to improve treatment of their workers;  in India, the Rugmark inspection team provides ‘social labels’ for  handknotted carpets made without child labor; and in Guatemala,  COVERCO monitors conditions in factories producing clothing under contract for major American brands. Seidman compares these cases to explore the ingredients of successful campaigns, as well as the inherent limitations facing voluntary monitoring schemes. Despite activists’ emphasis on educating individual consumers to support ethical companies, Seidman finds that, in practice, they have been most successful when they mobilized institutions—such as universities, churches, and shareholder organizations. Moreover, although activists tend to dismiss states’ capabilities, all three cases involved governmental threats of trade sanctions against companies and countries with poor labor records. Finally, Seidman  points to an intractable difficulty of independent workplace monitoring: since consumers rarely distinguish between monitoring schemes and labels, companies can hand pick monitoring organizations, selecting those with the lowest standards for working conditions and the least aggressive inspections. Transnational consumer movements can increase the bargaining power of the global workforce, Seidman argues, but they cannot replace national governments or local campaigns to expand the meaning of citizenship.<br><br>\n\nAs trade and capital move across borders in growing volume and with greater speed, civil society and human rights movements are also becoming more global. Highly original and thought-provoking, Beyond the Boycott vividly depicts the contemporary movement to humanize globalization—its present and its possible future.<br><br>\n\n[from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Government has become a refuge, and a relic, of America’s crumbling middle-class economy. As the public and private worlds of work have veered in different directions, the gaps between them are warping government work in unintended ways.<br><br>\n\nThree decades of economic turbulence have rendered American workplaces more demanding and less secure, more rewarding for high-end workers and punishing for workers without advanced skills. This workplace revolution, however, has largely bypassed government. Public employees—representing roughly one-sixth of the total workforce—still work under the conditions of dampened risk and constrained opportunity that marked most of the economy during the middle-class boom following World War II.<br><br>\n\nThe divergent paths of public and private employment have intensified a long-standing pattern: elite workers spurn public jobs, while less skilled workers cling to government work as a refuge from a harsh private economy. The first trend creates a chronic talent deficit in the public sector. The second trend makes the government workplace rigid and resistant to change. And both contribute to shortfalls in public-sector performance.<br><br>\n\nThe Warping of Government Work documents government’s isolation from the rest of the American economy and arrays the stark choices we confront for narrowing, or accommodating, the divide between public and private work.\n[from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "This edited volume in SIOP's Organizational Frontiers Series presents the current thinking and research on the important area of motivation Work Motivation is a central issue in industrial organizational psychology, human resource management and organizational behavior. In this volume the editors and authors show that motivation must be seen as a multi-level phenomenon where individual, group, organizational and cultural variables must be considered to truly understand it. The book adopts an overall framework that encompasses \"internal\"--from the person--forces and \"external\"-from the immediate and more distant environment--forces. It is destined to challenge scholars of organizations to give renewed emphasis and attention to advancing our understanding of motivation in work situations. [from publisher web site]",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Roland Erne's view of transnational trade union networks challenges the assertion that no realistic prospect exists for remedying the European Union's democratic deficit-that is, its domination by corporate interests and lack of a cohesive European people. His book describes the emergence of a European trade union movement that crosses national boundaries. Erne assesses national and EU-level trade union politics in two core areas: wage bargaining in the European Monetary Union and job protection during transnational corporate mergers and restructuring. The wage coordination policies of the European metal and construction workers' unions and the unions' responses in the ABB-Alstom Power and Alcan-Pechiney-Algroup merger cases, Erne finds, show that the activities of labor are not confined to the national level: labor's policies have undergone Europeanization. This cross-national borrowing of tactics is itself proof of the increasing integration of European states and societies. European Unions is based on an exceptionally wide range of research methods, including statistical analysis, participant observation, and interviews with EU-level, national, and local trade unionists and works councilors. It also draws on a wide range of European, German, French, Italian, and Swiss union documents and a multilingual body of academic literature across several disciplines, including political science, sociology, and law. Erne's multilevel inquiry goes beyond country-by-country comparisons of national cases and his book will prove of great relevance to readers interested in the future of labor, social justice, and democracy in an increasingly integrated world.

    "DESCRIPTION": "Temporary agencies place approximately two and a half million people in jobs each day in the United States. Every year, about twelve million people use these placement agencies to find temporary work. Many Americans, even those who desire permanent jobs, decide to enter the labor market through the portal of temporary agencies. Compared with the post-World War II era, when it was a marginal labor practice, temporary employment is today an entrenched feature of jobs and labor markets. How have temporary employment relationships become so widespread and normalized? In The Good Temp, Vicki Smith and Esther B. Neuwirth provide some novel answers to this question. Their provocative analysis is based on an insider's view of the interior dynamics of a temporary help agency in Silicon Valley. It incorporates a historical perspective on the rise of the temporary help service industry. Smith and Neuwirth document how this powerful industry not only created a new market for temporary labor but also played a fundamental role in the erosion of the permanent employment model. They analyze how agencies themselves came to manufacture and market this reinvented product-the good temp, an employee who is effective and efficient, committed, and sometimes preferable to a permanent staff member. Joining extensive participant observation data with historical analysis, The Good Temp contains some surprising findings about temporary employment today and fills a significant gap in our understanding of this important labor relationship.

    "DESCRIPTION": "Human resource departments are key components in the people management system of nearly every medium-to-large organization in the industrial world. They provide a wide range of essential services relating to employees, including recruitment, compensation, benefits, training, and labor relations. A century ago, however, before the concept of human resource management had been invented, the supervision and care of employees at even the largest companies were conducted without written policies or formal planning, and often in harsh, arbitrary, and counterproductive ways. How did companies such as United States Steel manage a workforce of 160,000 employees at dozens of plants without a specialized personnel or industrial relations department? What led some of these organizations to introduce human resources practices at the end of the nineteenth century? How were the earliest personnel departments structured and what were their responsibilities? And how did the theory and implementation of human resources management evolve, both within industry and as an academic field of research and teaching?<br><br>\n\nIn Managing the Human Factor, Bruce E. Kaufman chronicles the origins and early development of human resource management (HRM) in the United States from the 1870s, when the Labor Problem emerged as the nation's primary domestic policy concern, to 1933 and the start of the New Deal. Through new archival research, an extensive review and synthesis of the historical and contemporary literatures, and case studies illustrating best (and worst) practices during this period, Kaufman identifies the fourteen ideas, events, and movements that led to the creation of specialized HRM departments in the late 1910s, as well as their further growth and development into strategic business units in the welfare capitalism period of the 1920s. The research presented in this book not only uncovers many new aspects of the early development of personnel and industrial relations but also challenges central parts of the contemporary interpretation of the concept and evolution of HRM. Rich with insights on both the present and past of human resource management, Managing the Human Factor will be widely regarded as the definitive account of the early history of employee management in American companies and a must-read for all those interested in the indispensable function of managing people in organizations.

    "DESCRIPTION": "The U.S. trade union movement finds itself today on a global battlefield filled with landmines and littered with the bodies of various social movements and struggles. Candid, incisive, and accessible, Solidarity Divided is a critical examination of labor's current crisis and a plan for a bold new way forward into the twenty-first century. Bill Fletcher and Fernando Gapasin, two longtime union insiders whose experiences as activists of color grant them a unique vantage on the problems now facing U.S. labor, offer a remarkable mix of vivid history and probing analysis. They chart changes in U.S. manufacturing, examine the onslaught of globalization, consider the influence of the environment on labor, and provide the first broad analysis of the fallout from the 2000 and 2004 elections on the U.S. labor movement. Ultimately calling for a wide-ranging reexamination of the ideological and structural underpinnings of today's labor movement, this is essential reading for understanding how the battle for social justice can be fought and won.

    "DESCRIPTION": "\"Few of the countless real-life stories of workplace discrimination suffered by men and women every day are ever told publicly. This book boldly and eloquently rights that wrong, going where no plaintiff testimony could ever dare because these stories are often too raw, honest, ambiguous, and nuanced to be told in court or reported in a newspaper.\" (from the Foreword)<BR><BR>\nTelling Stories out of Court reaches readers on both an intellectual and an emotional level, helping them to think about, feel, and share the experiences of women who have faced sexism and discrimination at work. It focuses on how the federal courts interpreted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Offering insights that law texts alone cannot, the short stories collected here-all but two written for this volume-help readers concentrate on the emotional content of the experience with less emphasis on the particulars of the law. Grouped into thematic parts titled \"In Their Proper Place,\" \"Unfair Treatment,\" \"Sexual Harassment,\" and \"Hidden Obstacles,\" the narratives are combined with interpretive commentary and legal analysis that anchor the book by revealing the impact this revolutionary law had on women in the workplace.<BR><BR>\nAt the same time, the stories succeed on their own terms as compelling works of fiction, from \"LaKeesha's Job Interview,\" in which a woman's ambition to move from welfare to work faces an ironic obstacle, to \"Plato, Again,\" in which a woman undergoing treatment for cancer finds her career crumble under her, to \"Vacation Days,\" which takes the reader inside the daily routine of a nanny who works at the whim of her employer.\n[from publisher web site]\n",

Globalization, the decline of trade unions, the spread of high performance work systems, and the emergence of a more feminized, flexible work-force have opened new avenues of inquiry. The SAGE Handbook of Industrial Relations charts these changes and analyzes them. It provides a systematic, comprehensive survey of the field. The book is organized into four interrelated sections: <br><br>\n•\tTheorizing Industrial Relations <br>\n•\tThe changing institutions that shape employment practice <br>\n•\tThe processes used by governments, employers, and unions <br>\n•\tIncome inequality, employee wellbeing, business performance, and national comparative advantages <br><br>\nThe result is a work of unprecedented scope and unparalleled ambition. It offers a complete guide to the central debates, new developments, and emerging themes in the field. It will quickly be recognized as the indispensable reference for teachers, students and researchers. It is relevant to economists, lawyers, sociologists, business and management researchers, and Industrial Relations specialists. [from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "This book identifies avenues leading to the revitalization of industrial relations as an academic discipline. The contributors, a stellar assemblage of the field's leading scholars, demonstrate there is much work to be done: the scope and intellectual content of industrial relations need to be reconsidered; academic and social institutions must be reshaped; and, new conceptual and practical issues demand attention. The authors of the present volume examine a broad range of issues.  Some chapters in this book explore the conceptual boundaries and core assumptions of the field; others examine topics including industrial relations law, social capital and industrial relations institutions, changes to the field's academic curricula, the impact of the structure of academic departments on industrial relations scholarship, the state of labor and employment journals, and new approaches to the integration of teaching and community service. There is a wrap-up chapter by MIT's Thomas Kochan that ties all this together and presents additional insights on the revitalization of the field. Industrial relations scholars, labor studies, sociology and business professors as well as many practitioners will find much to recommend in this book.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "In this new edition of Why Unions Matter, Michael D. Yates shows why unions still matter. Unions mean better pay, benefits, and working conditions for their members; they force employers to treat employees with dignity and respect; and at their best, they provide a way for workers to make society both more democratic and egalitarian. Yates uses simple language, clear data, and engaging examples to show why workers need unions, how unions are formed, how they operate, how collective bargaining works, the role of unions in politics, and what unions have done to bring workers together across the divides of race, gender, religion, and sexual orientation.<BR><BR>\nThe new edition not only updates the first, but also examines the record of the New Voice slate that took control of the AFL-CIO in 1995, the continuing decline in union membership and density, the Change to Win split in 2005, the growing importance of immigrant workers, the rise of worker centers, the impacts of and labor responses to globalization, and the need for labor to have an independent political voice. This is simply the best introduction to unions on the market.  [from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Across the United States, increasing numbers of employers are breaking, bending, or evading long-established laws and standards designed to protect workers, from the minimum wage to job safety standards to the right to organize. This “gloves-off economy,” no longer confined to a marginal set of sweatshops and fly-by-night small businesses, is sending shock waves into every corner of the low-wage labor market. In the process, employers who play by the rules are under growing pressure to follow suit, intensifying the search for low-cost business strategies across a wide range of industries and ratcheting up into ever higher reaches of the labor market. Although other books have touched on pieces of this problem, The Gloves-off Economy is the first to provide a comprehensive, integrated analysis—and quite a disturbing one.<br><br>\n\nThis book examines a range of gloves-off practices, the workers who are affected by them, and strategies for enforcing workplace standards. The editors, four respected labor scholars, have brought together economists, sociologists, labor attorneys, union strategists, and other experts to offer varying perspectives on both the problem and the creative solutions currently being explored in a wide range of communities and industries. Annette Bernhardt, Heather Boushey, Laura Dresser, and Chris Tilly and the volume's other authors combine rigorous analysis with a stirring call to renew worker protections in the twenty-first century.<br><br>\n\n[from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "On April 10, 1966, a crowd of 10,000 farm workers and supporters gathered at the California state capitol to celebrate victory in one of the most significant strikes in American history-one that made Cesar Chavez famous as leader of the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), which later became the United Farm Workers (UFW).  In Why David Sometimes Wins , Marshall Ganz tells the story of the UFW's ground-breaking victory, drawing out larger lessons from this dramatic tale. Since the 1900s, large-scale agricultural enterprises relied on migrant labor-a cheap, unorganized, and powerless workforce. In 1965, after successive waves of failed organizing attempts, the AFL-CIO, the Teamsters, and the three-year-old NFWA all found themselves on the ground, recruiting members. That year, some 800 Filipino grape workers began a strike, under the aegis of the AFL-CIO. The UFW soon joined the action with some 2,000 Mexican workers. The UFW's leaders turned the strike into a kind of civil rights struggle; they engaged in civil disobedience, mobilized support from churches and students, boycotted growers, and transformed their struggle into La Causa , a farm workers' movement that eventually triumphed over the grape industry's Goliath. Why did they succeed? How can the powerless challenge the powerful successfully? Ganz points to three elements: the greater motivation of their leaders; the diversity of their community ties, information, and skills; and their creative decision-making processes. In total, the ability, or resourcefulness, to devise good strategy and turn short-term advantages into long-term gains.<br><br>\n\nAs both a longtime movement organizer and scholar, Ganz provides insight unavailable anywhere else. Authoritative in scholarship and magisterial in scope, this book constitutes a seminal contribution to learning from the movement's struggles, set-backs, and successes.. [from publisher web site].",

The authors of the essays in Human Rights in Labor and Employment Relations focus in various ways on how the promotion and protection of human rights at workplaces here and around the world posit a new set of values and approaches that challenge every orthodoxy in the employment relations field, every practice and rule based in that orthodoxy, and even the underlying premises and intellectual foundations of contemporary labor and employment systems. The authors constitute a diverse and accomplished group of human rights activists, practitioners, and scholars. Implementing the theme of the volume, they address a wide range of important subjects: worker health and safety, child labor, worker freedom of association, migrant and forced labor, the human rights obligations of employers, workplace discrimination, and workers with disabilities. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for labor and employment research and, where relevant, make pragmatic proposals for change. [from publisher web site].

It also happens to have the largest and most complex labor-management partnership ever created in the United States. This book tells the story of that partnership-how it started, how it grew, who made it happen, and the lessons to be learned from its successes and complications. With twenty-seven unions and an organization as complex as 8.6-million-member Kaiser Permanente, establishing the partnership was not a simple task and maintaining it has proven to be extraordinarily challenging. Thomas A. Kochan, Adrienne E. Eaton, Robert B. McKersie, and Paul S. Adler are among a team of researchers who have been tracking the evolution of the partnership between Kaiser Permanente and the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions ever since 2001. They review the history of health care labor relations and present a profile of Kaiser Permanente as it has developed over the years. They then delve into the partnership, discussing its achievements and struggles, including the negotiation of the most innovative collective bargaining agreements in the history of American labor relations. They conclude with an assessment of the Kaiser partnership's effect on the larger health care system and its implications for labor-management relations in other industries.

    "DESCRIPTION": "\"The World of Child Labor\" details both the current and historical state of child labor in each region of the world, focusing on its causes, consequences, and cures. Child labor remains a problem of immense social and economic proportions throughout the developing world, and there is a global movement underway to do away with it. Volume editor Hugh D. Hindman has assembled an international team of leading child labor scholars, researchers, policy-makers, and activists to provide a comprehensive reference with over 220 essays. This volume first provides a current global snapshot with overview essays on the dimensions of the problem and those institutions and organizations combating child labor. Thereafter the organization of the work is regional, covering developed, developing, and less developed regions of the world.  The reference goes around the globe to document the contemporary and historical state of child labor within each major region (Africa, Latin and South America, North America, Europe, Middle East, Asia, and Oceania) including country-level accounts for nearly half of the world's nations. Country-level essays for more developed nations include historical material in addition to current issues in child labor. All country-level essays address specific facets of child labor problems, such as industries and occupations in which children commonly work, the national child welfare policy, occupational safety regulations, educational system, and laws, and often highlight significant initiatives against child labor.  Current statistical data accompany most country-level essays that include ratifications to UN and ILO conventions, the Human Development Index, human capital indicators, economic indicators, and national child labor surveys conducted by the Statistical Information and Monitoring Program on Child Labor. \"The World of Child Labor\" is designed to be a self-contained, comprehensive reference for high school, college, and professional researchers. Maps, photos, figures, tables, references, and index are included. [from publisher web site].",

    "DESCRIPTION": "An epic account of how working-class America hit the rocks in the political and economic upheavals of the ’70s, Stayin’ Alive is a wide-ranging cultural and political history that presents the decade in a whole new light. Jefferson Cowie’s edgy and incisive book—part political intrigue, part labor history, with large doses of American music, film, and TV lore—makes new sense of the ’70s as a crucial and poorly understood transition from the optimism of New Deal America to the widening economic inequalities and dampened expectations of the present.<BR><BR>\nStayin’ Alive takes us from the factory floors of Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Detroit to the Washington of Nixon, Ford, and Carter. Cowie connects politics to culture, showing how the big screen and the jukebox can help us understand how America turned away from the radicalism of the ’60s and toward the patriotic promise of Ronald Reagan. He also makes unexpected connections between the secrets of the Nixon White House and the failings of the George McGovern campaign, between radicalism and the blue-collar backlash, and between the earthy twang of Merle Haggard’s country music and the falsetto highs of Saturday Night Fever.<BR><BR>\nCowie captures nothing less than the defining characteristics of a new era. Stayin’ Alive is a book that will forever define a misunderstood decade. [from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "In this explicitly comparative work, Dorothy J. Solinger examines the effects of global markets on the domestic politics of major states. In the late 1970s, leaders around the world faced a need both to continue productive investment and to cut labor costs to compete internationally in a changed world market. To accommodate forces seemingly beyond their control, they often opted to reduce social protections and benefits that citizens had come to expect, in the process recalibrating their established political-economic coalitions. For countries whose governance was built on a coalition between workers and the state, the political conundrum was particularly intense.<p>\n\n<i>States' Gains, Labor's Losses</i> concentrates on three countries- China, France, and Mexico-where revolution-inspired political compacts between labor and the state had to be renegotiated. In all three cases, choices to forge a deepened dependence on international capital markets required the ruling parties to fire large numbers of workers and cut social benefits while attempting not to provoke widespread social unrest or even full-scale revolt among their supporters. China, France, and Mexico also shared strong legacies of protectionism and state intervention in the economy, so the decision of each to join a supranational economic organization (France and the EU, China and the GATT/WTO, Mexico and NAFTA) in the hope of alleviating crises of capital shortage involved submission to a new set of liberal economic rules that further compromised their sociopolitical compacts.<p>\n\nExamining a fundamental question about the dynamics of globalization and worker protest through an innovative comparative perspective, States' Gains, Labor's Losses emphasizes the growing tensions and new compromises between the working class and their political leaders in the face of intense international economic pressures.

But even bigger changes were on the way. Overcoming internal divisions that originated in its 1930s-inflected and civil rights-era militancy, 1199SEIU adopted a new strategy of labor-management cooperation to emerge as a key player in state and city politics. When SEIU president Andrew Stern laid plans in 2006 for a new national health care workers union that would simultaneously reach out to the unorganized and campaign for universal, national health insurance, he turned to 1199 president Dennis Rivera--and the 1199 political model--to lead the effort. With new material that updates the union's history since the 1990s, this book conveys the promise and problems of movement-building in the twenty-first century health care industry.

    "DESCRIPTION": "[from publisher web site]\nIt is widely recognized that social movements may spread - or 'diffuse' - from one site to another. Such diffusion, however, is a complex and multidimensional process that involves different actors, networks, and mechanisms. This complexity has spawned a large body of literature on different aspects of the diffusion process, yet a comprehensive framework remains an elusive target. This book is a response to that need, and its framework focuses on three basic analytical questions. First, what is being diffused? Second, how does diffusion occur? Finally, what is the impact of diffusion on organizational development and shifts in the scale of contentious politics? This volume suggests that diffusion is not a simple matter of political contagion or imitation; rather, it is a creative and strategic process marked by political learning, adaptation, and innovation.\n",

They famously shuttle coffee in a thousand newsrooms, congressional offices, and Hollywood studios, but they also deliver aid in Afghanistan, build the human genome, and pick up garbage. They are increasingly of all ages, and their numbers are growing fast—from 17 percent of college graduates in 1992 to 50 percent in 2008. A huge and increasing number of internships are illegal under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and this mass exploitation saves firms more than $600 million each year. Interns enjoy no workplace protections and no standing in courts of law—let alone benefits like health care. \n\nRoss Perlin has written the first exposé of this world of drudgery and aspiration. In this witty, astonishing, and serious investigative work, Perlin takes the reader inside both boutique nonprofits and megacorporations such as Disney (which employs 8,000 interns at Disney World alone). He profiles fellow interns, talks to academics and professionals about what unleashed this phenomenon, and explains why the intern boom is perverting workplace practices in locations all around the world. <p>\n\nInsightful and humorous, Intern Nation will transform the way we think about the culture of work.

Less reported is that working conditions in many countries around the world have deteriorated as rapidly as jobs have been lost--and this affects ten times as many people. Working conditions significantly impact our health, the amount of time we can spend with family, our options during momentous life events (such as the birth of a child or the death of a parent), and whether we keep or lose a job when the unexpected occurs. Inexplicably, the global community has nearly universally accepted the argument that any country that guarantees a floor of decent working conditions will suffer higher unemployment and will be less competitive.<p>\n\n<i>Raising the Global Floor</i> shatters this widely held view by presenting the first ever, global analysis of the relationship between labor conditions, national competitiveness, and unemployment rates in 190 countries. The authors' findings are dramatic. They show that there is no relationship between unemployment rates and providing basic protections in a series of critical areas. Strikingly, data also indicate that good working conditions can make countries <i>more</i> competitive. There are no long-term economic gains to be had if workers are denied paid sick leave, paid annual leave, paid parental leave, the right to a day of rest, and many other basic protections that would improve the quality of their lives.\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "In a book that confronts the moral choices that U.S. corporations make every day in the treatment of their workers, James A. Gross issues a clarion call for the transformation of the American workplace based on genuine respect for human rights, rather than whatever the economic and regulatory landscape might allow. Gross questions the nation's underlying fabric of values as reflected in its laws and our assumptions about workers and the workplace. Arguing that our market philosophy is incompatible with core principles of human rights, he forces readers to realign the country's labor policies so that they conform with the highest international human rights standards. To make his case, Gross assesses various aspects of U.S. labor relations—freedom of association, racial discrimination, management rights, workplace safety, and human resources—through the lens of internationally accepted human rights principles as standards of judgment. His findings are chilling.<BR><BR>\n\"Employers who maintain workplaces that require men and women and sometimes even children to risk their lives and endanger their health and eyes and limbs in order to earn a living are treating human life as cheap and are seeking their own gain through the desecration of human life,\" Gross argues, and such behavior should be considered as crimes against humanity rather than matters of efficiency, productivity, or morale. By revealing how truly unacceptable management's \"best practices\" can be when considered as human rights issues, A Shameful Business encourages a bold new vision for workers, whether organized or not, that would signify a radical rethinking of social values and the concept of workplace rights and justice in the courtroom, the boardroom, and on the shop floor.

At the same time, however, its employment relations system has undergone a gradual but fundamental transformation from stable and permanent employment with good benefits (often called the iron rice bowl), to a system characterized by highly precarious employment with no benefits for about 40 percent of the population. Similar transitions have occurred in other countries, such as Korea, although perhaps not at such a rapid pace as in China.

    "DESCRIPTION": "The labor movement sees coalitions as a key tool for union revitalization and social change, but there is little analysis of what makes them successful or the factors that make them fail. Amanda Tattersall—an organizer and labor scholar—addresses this gap in the first internationally comparative study of coalitions between unions and community organizations.<p>\n\nTattersall argues that coalition success must be measured by two criteria: whether campaigns produce social change and whether they sustain organizational strength over time. The book contributes new, practical frameworks and insights that will help guide union and community organizers across the globe. The book throws down the gauntlet to industrial relations scholars and labor organizers, making a compelling case for unions to build coalitions that wield \"power with\" community organizations.<p>\n\nThe book centers on three detailed case studies: the public education coalition in Sydney, the Ontario Health Coalition in Toronto, and the living wage campaign run by the Grassroots Collaborative in Chicago. Together they enable Tattersall to explore when and how coalition unionism is the best and most appropriate strategy for social change, organizational development, and union renewal.<p>\n\nPower in Coalition presents clear lessons. Tattersall suggests that \"less is more,\" because it is often easier to build stronger coalitions with fewer organizations making decisions and sharing resources. She finds the role of the individual is traditionally underestimated, even though a coalition's success depends on a leader's ability to broker relationships between organizations while developing the campaign's strategy. The crafting of goals that combine organizational interest and the public interest and take into account electoral politics are crucial elements of coalition success. [from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Employee participation encompasses the range of mechanisms used to involve the workforce in decisions at all levels of the organization--whether direct or indirect--conducted with employees or through their representatives. In its various guises, the topic of employee participation has been a recurring theme in industrial relations and human resource management. One of the problems in trying to develop any analysis of participation is that there is potentially limited overlap between these different disciplinary traditions, and scholars from diverse traditions may know relatively little of the research that has been done elsewhere. Accordingly in this book, a number of the more significant disciplinary areas are analyzed in greater depth in order to ensure that readers gain a better appreciation of what participation means from these quite different contextual perspectives.<BR><BR>\nNot only is there a range of different traditions contributing to the research and literature on the subject, there is also an extremely diverse sets of practices that congregate under the banner of participation. The handbook discusses various arguments and schools of thought about employee participation, analyzes the range of forms that participation can take in practice, and examines the way in which it meets objectives that are set for it, either by employers, trade unions, individual workers, or, indeed, the state. <BR><BR>\nIn doing so, the handbook brings together leading scholars from around the world who present and discuss fundamental theories and approaches to participation in organization as well as their connection to broader political forces. These selections address the changing contexts of employee participation, different cultural/ institutional models, old/'new' economy models, shifting social and political patterns, and the correspondence between industrial and political democracy and participation. <BR><BR>\n[from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "This book is about the protest movement that captivated the nation and paved the path for Occupy Wall Street.  More than 100,000 public employees, teachers, students, and their allies descended on the capital in Madison, Wisconsin after Governor Scott Walker announced his plan to eliminate the right of public sector employees to unionize. The struggle (and the Democratic caucus’ escape to Indiana in order to prevent a quorum from being reached) elicited extensive national media coverage and debate—as well as enormous grassroots support for protestors. Uprising provides an anatomy of the event and its implications for the political future of the nation. As state legislatures across the US (in Ohio and New Hampshire, to name a few) take up union busting measures, Nichols shows how the Wisconsin case is a blueprint for progressives around America who’ve had enough. He also explores how Wisconsin protesters organized and inspired the Occupy Wall Street movement.",

Over the past two decades the emergence and tremendous growth of the Internet has enabled more than a billion new individuals to participate in the global labor force, led to the automation and integration of numerous jobs, and provided a new platform for distance learning. Accompanying the explosion in connectivity, we have seen a shift in the focus of skill debates from a concern about loss of U.S. firm competitiveness to a loss of workforce competitiveness. Today the concerns extend to the offshoring of knowledge work in addition to factory labor; even high-end research and development and professional work is moving rapidly to China, India and other high-skill, low-wage nations.<p>\n\nTransforming the U.S. Workforce Development System brings together some of the leading scholars and practitioners working in the skills field to examine what research tells us about the current state of the U.S. skills system in comparative perspective and the major changes that are required to help better prepare U.S. workers for the challenges of competing in the decades ahead.

This book, edited by two specialists on comparative HRM and written by leading experts on each topic and from each region, explores the range of different approaches to conceptualising HRM, and highlights HRM policy and practice that occur in the various regions of the world. As such, the volume provides a challenge to the typical assumption that there are consistent problems in managing human resources around the globe that call for standardised solutions. Instead, the contributors emphasise the importance of institutional and cultural factors that make HRM a most context-sensitive management task.\n\nOffering a comprehensive view for readers with different interests, this insightful Handbook will prove to be an essential resource for academics, researchers and postgraduate students in international business, business administration, HRM, socio-economics and cross-cultural management. Practitioners interested in the cultural aspects of HRM will also find this Handbook invaluable. [from publisher web site]",

    "DESCRIPTION": "In <i>The Minimum Wage and Labor Market Outcomes</i>, Christopher Flinn argues that in assessing the effects of the minimum wage (in the United States and elsewhere), a behavioral framework is invaluable for guiding empirical work and the interpretation of results. Flinn develops a job search and wage bargaining model that is capable of generating labor market outcomes consistent with observed wage and unemployment duration distributions, and also can account for observed changes in employment rates and wages after a minimum wage change. Flinn uses previous studies from the minimum wage literature to demonstrate how his model can be used to rationalize and synthesize the diverse results found in widely varying institutional contexts. He also shows how observed wage distributions from before and after a minimum wage change can be used to determine if the change was welfare-improving. More ambitiously, and perhaps controversially, Flinn proposes the construction and formal estimation of the model using commonly available data; model estimates then enable the researcher to determine directly the welfare effects of observed minimum wage changes. This model can be used to conduct counterfactual policy experiments—even to determine \"optimal\" minimum wages under a variety of welfare metrics.<p>\n\nThe development of the model and the econometric theory underlying its estimation are carefully presented so as to enable readers unfamiliar with the econometrics of point process models and dynamic optimization in continuous time to follow the arguments. Although most of the book focuses on the case where only the unemployed search for jobs in a homogeneous labor market environment, later chapters introduce on-the-job search into the model, and explore its implications for minimum wage policy. The book also contains a chapter describing how individual heterogeneity can be introduced into the search, matching, and bargaining framework. [from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Deindustrialization in the United States has triggered record-setting joblessness in manufacturing centers from Detroit to Baltimore. At the same time, global competition and technological change have actually stimulated both new businesses and new jobs. The jury is still out, however, on how many of these positions represent a significant source of long-term job quality and security. <i>Where Are All the Good Jobs Going?</i> addresses the most pressing questions for today’s workers: whether the U.S. labor market can still produce jobs with good pay and benefits for the majority of workers and whether these jobs can remain stable over time. <p>\n\nWhat constitutes a “good” job, who gets them, and are they becoming more or less secure? <i>Where Are All the Good Jobs Going?</i> examines U.S. job quality and volatility from the perspectives of both workers and employers. The authors analyze the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the book covers data for twelve states during twelve years, 1992–2003, resulting in an unprecedented examination of workers and firms in several industries over time.<p>\n\nCounter to conventional wisdom, the authors find that good jobs are not disappearing, but their character and location have changed. The market produces fewer good jobs in manufacturing and more in professional services and finance. Not surprisingly, the best jobs with the highest pay still go to the most educated workers. The most vulnerable workers—older, low-income, and low-skilled—work in the most insecure environments where they can be easily downsized or displaced by a fickle labor market. A higher federal minimum wage and increased unionization can contribute to the creation of well paying jobs. So can economic strategies that help smaller metropolitan areas support new businesses. These efforts, however, must function in tandem with policies that prepare workers for available positions, such as improving general educational attainment and providing career education. <p>\n\n<i>Where Are All the Good Jobs Going?</i> makes clear that future policies will need to address not only how to produce good jobs but how to produce good workers. This cohesive study takes the necessary first steps with a sensible approach to the needs of workers and the firms that hire them. [from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Macroeconomic research on human capital--the stock of human capabilities and knowledge--has been extensively published but to date the literature has lacked a comprehensive analysis of human capital within the organization. The Oxford Handbook of Human Capital has been designed to fill that gap, providing an authoritative, inter-disciplinary, and up to date survey of relevant concepts, research areas, and applications. Specially commissioned contributions from over 40 authors reveal the importance of human capital for contemporary organizations, exploring its conceptual underpinnings, relevance to theories of the firm, implications for organizational effectiveness, interdependencies with other resources, and role in the future economy. Unlike neoclassical macroeconomic concepts of human capital, human capital in organizations is shown to be dynamic and heterogeneous, requiring new theories and management frameworks. The systemic role of human capital is explored, revealing it as the lynchpin of social, structural and other forms of intangible and tangible capital. Connections between human capital and organizational performance are investigated from HR management, procurement, alignment, value appropriation, and accounting perspectives. Links between micro and macro perspectives are provided through analyses of inter firm human capital mobility, national and regional human capital formation regimes and industry employment relations practices.\n\nThis Handbook is designed for scholars and graduate students of organization and management theory, strategy, entrepreneurship, knowledge and intellectual capital, accounting, IT, HR, IR, economic sociology and cultural studies. For policy makers and practitioners it should provide an up to date guide to the nature and role of human capital in contemporary organizations and the roles that government, industry and other extra firm institutions can play in facilitating its development.

    "DESCRIPTION": "What is work? Is it simply a burden to be tolerated or something more meaningful to one's sense of identity and self-worth? And why does it matter? In a uniquely thought-provoking book, John W. Budd presents ten historical and contemporary views of work from across the social sciences and humanities. By uncovering the diverse ways in which we conceptualize work—such as a way to serve or care for others, a source of freedom, a source of income, a method of psychological fulfillment, or a social relation shaped by class, gender, race, and power—<i>The Thought of Work</i> reveals the wide-ranging nature of work and establishes its fundamental importance for the human experience. When we work, we experience our biological, psychological, economic, and social selves. Work locates us in the world, helps us and others make sense of who we are, and determines our access to material and social resources.<p>\n\nBy integrating these distinct views, Budd replaces the usual fragmentary approaches to understanding the nature and meaning of work with a comprehensive approach that promotes a deep understanding of how work is understood, experienced, and analyzed. Concepts of work affect who and what is valued, perceptions of freedom and social integration, identity construction, evaluations of worker well-being, the legitimacy and design of human resource management practices, support for labor unions and labor standards, and relationships between religious faith and work ethics. By drawing explicit attention to diverse, implicit meanings of work, <i>The Thought of Work</i> allows us to better understand work, to value it, and to structure it in desirable ways that reflect its profound importance.

It describes wages, wage differences across groups, wage inequality, how organizations set pay and why, executive and 'superstar' pay, the difference between pay and 'total rewards' (including benefits, opportunities for growth, colleagues and working conditions), compensation in nonprofits, and the differences between the cost of compensation to organizations and the value employees place on that compensation. It also offers tips on what an individual can do to earn more. [from publisher web site]",

    "DESCRIPTION": "This volume in <i>The SAGE Reference Series on Disability</i> explores issues facing people with disabilities in employment and the work environment. It is one of eight volumes in the cross-disciplinary and issues-based series, which incorporates links from varied fields making up Disability Studies as volumes examine topics central to the lives of individuals with disabilities and their families. With a balance of history, theory, research, and application, specialists set out the findings and implications of research and practice for others whose current or future work involves the care and/or study of those with disabilities, as well as for the disabled themselves. The presentational style (concise and engaging) emphasizes accessibility. Taken individually, each volume sets out the fundamentals of the topic it addresses, accompanied by compiled data and statistics, recommended further readings, a guide to organizations and associations, and other annotated resources, thus providing the ideal introductory platform and gateway for further study. Taken together, the series represents both a survey of major disability issues and a guide to new directions and trends and contemporary resources in the field as a whole. [from publisher web site]",

    "DESCRIPTION": "The first major volume to place U.S.-centered labor history in a transnational focus, Workers Across the Americas collects the newest scholarship of Canadianist, Caribbeanist, and Latin American specialists as well as U.S. historians. These essays highlight both the supra- and sub-national aspect of selected topics without neglecting nation-states themselves as historical forces. Indeed, the transnational focus opens new avenues for understanding changes in the concepts, policies, and practice of states, their interactions with each other and their populations, and the ways in which the popular classes resist, react, and advance their interests. <br><br>\n\nWhat does this transnational turn encompass? And what are its likely perils as well as promise as a framework for research and analysis? To address these questions John French, Julie Greene, Neville Kirk, Aviva Chomsky, Dirk Hoerder, and Vic Satzewich lead off the volume with critical commentaries on the project of transnational labor history. Their responses offer a tour of explanations, tensions, and cautions in the evolution of a new arena of research and writing. Thereafter, Workers Across the Americas groups fifteen research essays around themes of labor and empire, indigenous peoples and labor systems, international feminism and reproductive labor, labor recruitment and immigration control, transnational labor politics, and labor internationalism. Topics range from military labor in the British Empire to coffee workers on the Guatemalan/Mexican border to the role of the International Labor Organization in attempting to set common labor standards. Leading scholars introduce each section and recommend further reading.  [from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "In August 1981, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) called an illegal strike. The new president, Ronald Reagan, fired the strikers, establishing a reputation for both decisiveness and hostility to organized labor. As Joseph A. McCartin writes, the strike was the culmination of two decades of escalating conflict between controllers and the government that stemmed from the high-pressure nature of the job and the controllers' inability to negotiate with their employer over vital issues. PATCO's fall not only ushered in a long period of labor decline; it also served as a harbinger of the campaign against public sector unions that now roils American politics.<p>\n\nCollision Course sets the strike within a vivid panorama of the rise of the world's busiest air-traffic control system. It begins with an arresting account of the 1960 midair collision over New York that cost 134 lives and exposed the weaknesses of an overburdened system. Through the stories of controllers like Mike Rock and Jack Maher, who were galvanized into action by that disaster and went on to found PATCO, it describes the efforts of those who sought to make the airways safer and fought to win a secure place in the American middle class. It climaxes with the story of Reagan and the controllers, who surprisingly endorsed the Republican on the promise that he would address their grievances. That brief, fateful alliance triggered devastating miscalculations that changed America, forging patterns that still govern the nation's labor politics.<p>\n\nWritten with an eye for detail and a grasp of the vast consequences of the PATCO conflict for both air travel and America's working class, Collision Course is a stunning achievement.

    "DESCRIPTION": "Walmart and \"Made in China\" are practically synonymous; Walmart imports some 70 percent of its merchandise from China. Walmart is now also rapidly becoming a major retail presence there, with close to two hundred Walmarts in more than a hundred Chinese cities. What happens when the world's biggest retailer and the world's biggest country do business with each other? In this book, a group of thirteen experts from several disciplines examine the symbiotic but strained relationship between these giants. The book shows how Walmart began cutting costs by bypassing its American suppliers and sourcing directly from Asia and how Walmart's sheer size has trumped all other multinationals in squeezing procurement prices and, as a by-product, driving down Chinese workers' wages.<p>\n\nChina is also an inviting frontier for Walmart's global superstore expansion. As China's middle class grows, the chain's Western image and affordable goods have become popular. Walmart's Arkansas headquarters exports to the Chinese stores a unique corporate culture and management ideology, which oddly enough are reminiscent of Mao-era Chinese techniques for promoting loyalty. Three chapters separately detail the lives of a Walmart store manager, a lower-level store supervisor, and a cashier. Another chapter focuses on employees' wages, \"voluntary\" overtime, and the stores' strict labor discipline. In 2006, the official Chinese trade union targeted Walmart, which is antilabor in its home country, and succeeded in setting up union branches in all the stores. Walmart in China reveals the surprising outcome.  [from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "<i>Working Hard for the American Dream</i> presents an in-depth examination of the various economic, social, and political developments that shaped labor history in the United States from World War I until the present day. By taking a working-class perspective, the text vividly illustrates the ways average workers experienced the U.S. economy's changing nature, the relationship of the government to workers, and how global economic and political forces affected—and were affected by—working Americans.  We are shown how evolving economic developments and the changing composition of the nation's working class affected working-class agency and protest, ideologies, and organization. Workers' struggle to exert power in the modern workplace is also examined, along with how and why workplace activism has changed over time among a broad range of industrial, agricultural, public, and service workers. Incorporating the most recent scholarship in labor history, <i>Working Hard for the American Dream</i> offers illuminating insights into 20th-century union history in the United States.

    "DESCRIPTION": "More than three billion people, nearly half of humankind, live on less than two-and-a-half U.S. dollars per person per day. Studies have shown repeatedly that the main and often the sole asset of the poor is their labor. It follows that to understand global poverty one must understand labor markets and labor earnings in the developing world. Excellent books exist on ending world poverty that discuss in depth many important aspects of economic development but do not focus on employment and self-employment, work and non-work. <i>Working Hard, Working Poor</i> fills in where the other books leave off.<p>\n\nIssues of analyzing poverty and low earnings in the developing world are quite different from those in the developed world. The discourse in the developed world is about incentive effects of social welfare programs, cultures of poverty, single-parenthood, homelessness, drug and alcohol abuse, ill health, mental illness, domestic violence, and the like. But in the developing world, different issues predominate, such as own-account work and household enterprises, agricultural work, casual employment, and informal work. And some of the policy issues--stimulating economic growth, harnessing the energies of the private sector, increasing paid employment, and raising the returns to self-employment--take a different twist. This book shows how people in poverty work, what has been effective in helping the poor earn their way out of poverty, and how readers might help.  [from publisher web site]\n",

Each case is based in a single country and illustrates one or more significant challenge faced by managers and HR practitioners. The influence of the unique national cultural and institutional context upon the issues in the case is emphasized. In total 32 unique and original cases are presented, each from different national contexts. Every case is followed by a set of questions for use in class discussion or private study of the cases. <p>\n\nThis casebook is a project undertaken by a committee of international members of the Human Resources Division of the Academy of Management (USA). The HR Division currently has over 3500 members worldwide, indicating a significant immediate audience for the text. The committee, referred to as the HR Ambassadors Committee (James Hayton, Chair) is intended to represent the global membership of the organization. We currently have members in over 60 countries, and Ambassadors for over 50 of these. The committee was established to contribute to the internationalization of the HR Division and the Academy of Management by creating collaborative projects that both involve and serve the global membership. This book, which represents the first product of our collaboration, is expected to provide a useful teaching tool for HRM educators, and secondarily is expected to be of use to HR practitioners with an interest in the globalization of HRM.

    "DESCRIPTION": "An unprecedented redistribution of American jobs, population, and wealth is under way, and it is likely to accelerate in the years to come. In this important and persuasive book, Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti reveals this \"new geography of jobs\" that's benefiting centers of innovation like San Francisco, Boston, Austin, and Durham. And the winners and losers aren't necessarily who you'd expect. Moretti's groundbreaking research shows that you don't have to be a scientist or an engineer to thrive in one of these brain hubs.<p>\n\nAmong the beneficiaries are the workers who support the \"idea-creators\"—the carpenters, hair stylists, personal trainers, lawyers, doctors, and teachers. In fact, Moretti has shown that for every new innovation job in a city, five additional non-innovation jobs are created, and those workers earn higher salaries than their counterparts in other urban areas. It wasn't supposed to be this way. As the global economy shifted from manufacturing to innovation, geography was supposed to matter less. But the pundits were wrong. A new map is being drawn and it's not about red versus blue or rich versus poor. The rise of American brain hubs is causing huge geographic disparities in education, income, life expectancy, family stability, and political engagement. Dealing with this split—encouraging growth in the hubs while arresting the decline elsewhere—will be the challenge of the century, and <i>The New Geography of Jobs</i> lights the way.

    "DESCRIPTION": "Prior to the millennium, economists and policy makers argued that free trade between the United States and Mexico would benefit both Americans and Mexicans. They believed that NAFTA would be a “win-win” proposition that would offer U.S. companies new markets for their products and Mexicans the hope of living in a more developed country with the modern conveniences of wealthier nations. Blending rigorous economic and statistical analysis with concern for the people affected, <i>Mexican Women in American Factories</i> offers the first assessment of whether NAFTA has fulfilled these expectations by examining its socioeconomic impact on workers in a Mexican border town.<p>\n\nCarolyn Tuttle led a group that interviewed 620 women maquila workers in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. The responses from this representative sample refute many of the hopeful predictions made by scholars before NAFTA and reveal instead that little has improved for maquila workers. The women’s stories make it plain that free trade has created more low-paying jobs in sweatshops where workers are exploited. Families of maquila workers live in one- or two-room houses with no running water, no drainage, and no heat. The multinational companies who operate the maquilas consistently break Mexican labor laws by requiring women to work more than nine hours a day, six days a week, without medical benefits, while the minimum wage they pay workers is insufficient to feed their families. These findings will make a crucial contribution to debates over free trade, CAFTA-DR, and the impact of globalization.  [from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "In all Western societies women earn lower wages on average than men. The gender wage gap has existed for many years, although there have been some important changes over time. This volume of collected papers contains extensive research on progress made by women in the labor market, and the characteristics and causes of remaining gender inequalities. It also covers other dimensions of inequality and their interplay with gender, such as family formation, wellbeing, race, and immigrant status. The author was awarded the 2010 IZA Prize in Labor Economics for this research. <p>\n\nPart I comprises an Introduction by the Editors (Anne C. Gielen and Klaus F. Zimmermann).  Part II probes and quantifies the explanations for the gender wage gap, including differential choices made in the labor market by men and women as well as labor market discrimination and employment segregation. It also delineates how the gender wage gap has decreased over time in the United States and suggests explanations for this narrowing of the gap and the more recent slowdown in wage convergence. <p>\n\nPart III considers international differences in the gender wage gap and wage inequality and the relationship between the two. Part IV considers a variety of indicators of gender inequality and how they have changed over time in the United States, painting a picture of significant gains in women's relative status across a number of dimensions. It also considers the trends in female labor supply and what they indicate about changing gender roles in the United States and considers a successful intervention designed to increase the relative success of academic women. <p>\n\nPart V focuses on inequality by race and immigrant status. It considers not only race difference in wages and the differential progress made by African-American women and men in reducing the race wage gap, but also race differences in wealth which are considerably larger than differences in wages. It also examines immigrant-native differences in the use of transfer payments, and the impact of gender roles in immigrant source countries on immigrant women's labor market assimilation in the U.S. labor market..

    "DESCRIPTION": "Since 1988, <i>The State of Working America</i> has provided a comprehensive answer to a question newly in vogue in this age of Occupy Wall Street: To what extent has overall economic growth translated into rising living standards for the vast majority of American workers and their families? In the 12th edition, Lawrence Mishel, Josh Bivens, Elise Gould, and Heidi Shierholz analyze a trove of data on income, jobs, mobility, poverty, wages, and wealth to demonstrate that rising economic inequality over the past three decades has decoupled overall economic growth from growth in the living standards of the vast majority.<p>\n\nThe new edition of <i>The State of Working America</i> also expands on this analysis of American living standards, most notably by placing the Great Recession in historical context. The severe economic downturn that began in December 2007 came on the heels of a historically weak recovery following the 2001 recession, a recovery that saw many measures of living standards stagnate. The authors view the past decade as “lost” in terms of living standards growth, and warn that millions of American households face another decade of lost opportunity.<p>\n\nEspecially troubling, the authors stress, is that while overall economic performance in the decades before the Great Recession was more than sufficient to broadly raise living standards, broad-based growth was blocked by rising inequality driven largely by policy choices. A determinedly data-driven narrative, <i>The State of Working America</i> remains the most comprehensive resource about the economic experience of working Americans.

    "DESCRIPTION": "How do restaurant workers live on some of the lowest wages in America? And how do poor working conditions—discriminatory labor practices, exploitation, and unsanitary kitchens—affect the meals that arrive at our restaurant tables? Saru Jayaraman, who launched the national restaurant workers' organization Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, sets out to answer these questions by following the lives of restaurant workers in New York City, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Miami, Detroit, and New Orleans.<p>\n\nBlending personal narrative and investigative journalism, Jayaraman shows us that the quality of the food that arrives at our restaurant tables depends not only on the sourcing of the ingredients. Our meals benefit from the attention and skill of the people who chop, grill, sauté, and serve. <i>Behind the Kitchen Door</i> is a groundbreaking exploration of the political, economic, and moral implications of dining out. Jayaraman focuses on the stories of individuals, like Daniel, who grew up on a farm in Ecuador and sought to improve the conditions for employees at Del Posto; the treatment of workers behind the scenes belied the high-toned Slow Food ethic on display in the front of the house.<p>\n\nIncreasingly, Americans are choosing to dine at restaurants that offer organic, fair-trade, and free-range ingredients for reasons of both health and ethics. Yet few of these diners are aware of the working conditions at the restaurants themselves. But whether you eat haute cuisine or fast food, the well-being of restaurant workers is a pressing concern, affecting our health and safety, local economies, and the life of our communities. Highlighting the roles of the 10 million people, many immigrants, many people of color, who bring their passion, tenacity, and vision to the American dining experience, Jayaraman sets out a bold agenda to raise the living standards of the nation's second-largest private sector workforce—and ensure that dining out is a positive experience on both sides of the kitchen door.  \n[from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "The Great Recession that began in 2007 was marked by high rates of unemployment, the near collapse of the banking sector, and the bankruptcy of a host of venerable firms. The economy has only slowly recovered over the intervening years. Throughout this time, the labor movement has faced numerous challenges; among them declining union membership, lackluster organizing performance, and difficulties at the bargaining table. Collective bargaining came under especially severe pressure in both private and public sectors. Employers were now more aggressive than in the 1980s, and unions were expected to concede with no promises of anything in return.<p>\n\n<i>Collective Bargaining under Duress</i> highlights the recent state of collective bargaining in eight different industries across both the private and public sectors. The contributors document the struggles common throughout in new organizing, securing viable collective agreements for members after winning election, and protecting earlier hard-won gains in the face of increasingly aggressive employer opposition.

    "DESCRIPTION": "Thirty years after women became 50 percent of the college graduates in the United States, men still hold the vast majority of leadership positions in government and industry. This means that women’s voices are still not heard equally in the decisions that most affect our lives. In <i>Lean In</i>, Sheryl Sandberg examines why women’s progress in achieving leadership roles has stalled, explains the root causes, and offers compelling, commonsense solutions that can empower women to achieve their full potential. <p>\n\nSandberg is the chief operating officer of Facebook and is ranked on <i>Fortune</i>’s list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business and as one of <i>Time</i>’s 100 Most Influential People in the World. In 2010, she gave an electrifying TEDTalk in which she described how women unintentionally hold themselves back in their careers. Her talk, which became a phenomenon and has been viewed more than two million times, encouraged women to “sit at the table,” seek challenges, take risks, and pursue their goals with gusto.<p>\n\nIn <i>Lean In</i>, Sandberg digs deeper into these issues, combining personal anecdotes, hard data, and compelling research to cut through the layers of ambiguity and bias surrounding the lives and choices of working women. She recounts her own decisions, mistakes, and daily struggles to make the right choices for herself, her career, and her family. She provides practical advice on negotiation techniques, mentorship, and building a satisfying career, urging women to set boundaries and to abandon the myth of “having it all.”  She describes specific steps women can take to combine professional achievement with personal fulfillment and demonstrates how men can benefit by supporting women in the workplace and at home. <p>\n\nWritten with both humor and wisdom, Sandberg’s book is an inspiring call to action and a blueprint for individual growth. <i>Lean In</i> is destined to change the conversation from what women can’t do to what they can.

    "DESCRIPTION": "During the middle third of the 20th century, workers in most industrialized countries secured a substantial measure of job security, whether through legislation, contract or social practice. This “standard employment contract,” as it was known, became the foundation of an impressive array of rights and entitlements, including social insurance and pensions, protection against unsociable working conditions, and the right to bargain collectively. Recent changes in technology and the global economy, however, have dramatically eroded this traditional form of employment. Employers now value flexibility over stability, and increasingly hire employees for short-term or temporary work. Many countries have also repealed labor laws, relaxed employee protections, and reduced state-provided benefits. As the old system of worker protection declines, how can labor regulation be improved to protect workers? In <i>Rethinking Workplace Regulation</i>, nineteen leading scholars from ten countries and half a dozen disciplines present a sweeping tour of the latest policy experiments across the world that attempt to balance worker security and the new flexible employment paradigm. <p>\n\nWith its ambitious scope and broad inquiry, <i>Rethinking Workplace Regulation</i> illustrates the diverse innovations countries have developed to confront the policy challenges created by the changing nature of work. The experiments evaluated in this volume will provide inspiration and instruction for policymakers and advocates seeking to improve worker’s lives in this latest era of global capitalism.

    "DESCRIPTION": "Work is, and always will be, a central institution of society. What makes a capitalist society unique is that it treats the human capacity to engage in labor as a basic commodity. This can be a source of dynamism, as when innovative firms raise wages to attract the best and brightest. But it can also be a source of misery, as when one’s skills are suddenly rendered obsolete by forces beyond one’s control.  <p>\nJeffrey J. Sallaz asks us to rethink our basic assumptions about work. Drawing on cutting-edge theories within economic sociology and through the use of contemporary examples, he conceptualizes labor as embedded exchange. This draws attention to issues that all too frequently are overlooked in our public discourse and private imaginations: how various forms of work are classified and valued; how markets for labor operate in practice; and how people can challenge the central fiction that their work is simply a commodity to be bought and sold. <p>\nThis readable and engaging book is suitable for both graduate and advanced undergraduate students. It will be of interest to economic sociologists, scholars of labor, and all of those who find themselves working for a living.\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Critics on the left and the right typically agree that globalization, the loss of manufacturing jobs, and the expansion of the service sector have led to income inequality and rising numbers of low-paying jobs with poor working conditions. <p>\nIn <i>Degraded Work</i>, Marc Doussard demonstrates that this decline in wages and working conditions is anything but the unavoidable result of competitive economic forces. Rather, he makes the case that service sector and other local-serving employers have boosted profit with innovative practices to exploit workers, demeaning their jobs in new ways—denying safety equipment, fining workers for taking scheduled breaks, requiring unpaid overtime—that go far beyond wage cuts. Doussard asserts that the degradation of service work is a choice rather than an inevitability, and he outlines concrete steps that can be taken to help establish a fairer postindustrial labor market. <p>\nDrawing on fieldwork in Chicago, <i>Degraded Work</i> examines changes in two industries in which inferior job quality is assumed to be intrinsic: residential construction and food retail. In both cases, Doussard shows how employers degraded working conditions as part of a successful and intricate strategy to increase profits. Arguing that a growing service sector does not have to mean growing inequality, Doussard proposes creative policy and organizing opportunities that workers and advocates can use to improve job quality despite the overwhelming barriers to national political action. <p>\n[from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "In <i>Made in the USA</i>, Vaclav Smil powerfully rebuts the notion that manufacturing is a relic of pre-digital history and that the loss of American manufacturing is a desirable evolutionary step toward a pure service economy. Smil argues that no advanced economy can prosper without a strong, innovative manufacturing sector and the jobs it creates. Reversing a famous information economy dictum, Smil argues that serving potato chips is not as good as making microchips. The history of manufacturing in America, Smil tells us, is a story of nation-building. He explains how manufacturing became a fundamental force behind America's economic, strategic, and social dominance. He describes American manufacturing's rapid rise at the end of the nineteenth century, its consolidation and modernization between the two world wars, its role as an enabler of mass consumption after 1945, and its recent decline. Some economists argue that shipping low-value jobs overseas matters little because the high-value work remains in the United States. But, asks Smil, do we want a society that consists of a small population of workers doing high-value-added work and masses of unemployed? Smil assesses various suggestions for solving America's manufacturing crisis, including lowering corporate tax rates, promoting research and development, and improving public education. Will America act to preserve and reinvigorate its manufacturing? It is crucial to our social and economic well-being; but, Smil warns, the odds are no better than even.  [from publisher web site]",

    "DESCRIPTION": "<i>Unfinished Business</i> documents the history and impact of California's paid family leave program, the first of its kind in the United States, which began in 2004. Drawing on original data from fieldwork and surveys of employers, workers, and the larger California adult population, Ruth Milkman and Eileen Appelbaum analyze in detail the effect of the state’s landmark paid family leave on employers and workers. They also explore the implications of California’s decade-long experience with paid family leave for the nation, which is engaged in ongoing debate about work-family policies.<p>\n\nMilkman and Appelbaum recount the process by which California workers and their allies built a coalition to win passage of paid family leave in the state legislature, and lay out the lessons for advocates in other states and localities, as well as the nation. Because paid leave enjoys extensive popular support across the political spectrum, campaigns for such laws have an excellent chance of success if some basic preconditions are met. Do paid family leave and similar programs impose significant costs and burdens on employers? Business interests argue that they do and routinely oppose any and all legislative initiatives in this area. Once the program took effect in California, this book shows, large majorities of employers themselves reported that its impact on productivity, profitability, and performance was negligible or positive.<p>\n\n<i>Unfinished Business</i> demonstrates that the California program is well managed and easy to access, but that awareness of its existence remains limited. Moreover, those who need the program’s benefits most urgently—low-wage workers, young workers, immigrants, and disadvantaged minorities—are least likely to know about it. As a result, the long-standing pattern of inequality in access to paid leave has remained largely intact. <p>\n[from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "What role should racial difference play in the American workplace? As a nation, we rely on civil rights law to address this question, and the monumental Civil Rights Act of 1964 seemingly answered it: race must not be a factor in workplace decisions. In After Civil Rights, John Skrentny contends that after decades of mass immigration, many employers, Democratic and Republican political leaders, and advocates have adopted a new strategy to manage race and work. Race is now relevant not only in negative cases of discrimination, but in more positive ways as well. In today's workplace, employers routinely practice \"racial realism,\" where they view race as real--as a job qualification. Many believe employee racial differences, and sometimes immigrant status, correspond to unique abilities or evoke desirable reactions from clients or citizens. They also see racial diversity as a way to increase workplace dynamism. The problem is that when employers see race as useful for organizational effectiveness, they are often in violation of civil rights law. <p>\n\nAfter Civil Rights examines this emerging strategy in a wide range of employment situations, including the low-skilled sector, professional and white-collar jobs, and entertainment and media. In this important book, Skrentny urges us to acknowledge the racial realism already occurring, and lays out a series of reforms that, if enacted, would bring the law and lived experience more in line, yet still remain respectful of the need to protect the civil rights of all workers.

    "DESCRIPTION": "New York City boasts a higher rate of unionization than any other major U.S. city—roughly double the national average—but the city's unions have suffered steady and relentless decline, especially in the private sector. With higher levels of income inequality than any other large city in the nation, New York today is home to a large and growing \"precariat\": workers with little or no employment security who are often excluded from the basic legal protections that unions struggled for and won in the twentieth century.<p>\n\nCommunity-based organizations and worker centers have developed the most promising approach to organizing the new precariat and to addressing the crisis facing the labor movement. Home to some of the nation's very first worker centers, New York City today has the single largest concentration of these organizations in the United States, yet until now no one has documented their efforts.<p>\n\n<i>New Labor in New York</i> includes thirteen fine-grained case studies of recent campaigns by worker centers and unions, each of which is based on original research and participant observation. Some of the campaigns documented here involve taxi drivers, street vendors, and domestic workers, as well as middle-strata freelancers, all of whom are excluded from basic employment laws. Other cases focus on supermarket, retail, and restaurant workers, who are nominally covered by such laws but who often experience wage theft and other legal violations; still other campaigns are not restricted to a single occupation or industry. This book offers a richly detailed portrait of the new labor movement in New York City, as well as several recent efforts to expand that movement from the local to the national scale.

    "DESCRIPTION": "In <I>The Chicken Trail</I>, Kathleen C. Schwartzman examines the impact of globalization—and of NAFTA in particular—on the North American poultry industry, focusing on the displacement of African American workers in the southeast United States and workers in Mexico. Schwartzman documents how the transformation of U.S. poultry production in the 1980s increased its export capacity and changed the nature and consequences of labor conflict. She documents how globalization—and NAFTA in particular—forced Mexico to open its commodity and capital markets, and eliminate state support of corporations and rural smallholders. As a consequence, many Mexicans were forced to abandon their no longer sustainable small farms, with some seeking work in industrialized poultry factories north of the border.<p>\n\nBy following this chicken trail, Schwartzman breaks through the deadlocked immigration debate, highlighting the broader economic and political contexts of immigration flows. The narrative that undocumented worker take jobs that Americans don't want to do is too simplistic. Schwartzman argues instead that illegal immigration is better understood as a labor story in which the hiring of undocumented workers is part of a management response to the crises of profit making and labor-management conflict. By placing the poultry industry at the center of a constellation of competing individual, corporate, and national interests and such factors as national debt, free trade, economic development, industrial restructuring, and African American unemployment, <I>The Chicken Trail</I> makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the implications of globalization for labor and how the externalities of free trade and neoliberalism become the social problems of nations and the tragedies of individuals.<p>\n [from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Belman and Wolfson have compiled the most comprehensive, analytical, and unbiased assessment of the effects of minimum wage increases that has ever been produced. Based on a rigorous meta-analysis of more than 200 scholarly publications published since 1991 (most after 2000) that address the various impacts of raising the minimum wage, the authors observe several outcomes influenced by increases in the minimum wage, how long it takes those outcomes to respond, the magnitude of effects, why increases in the minimum wage have the results they do, and the workers most likely to be impacted. The breadth and depth of their investigation clarifies the issues surrounding employment, wages, poverty and inequality, and effect by gender.<p>\n\nThis is essential reading for anyone interested in the effects of raising the minimum wage.\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Private equity firms have long been at the center of public debates on the impact of the financial sector on Main Street companies. Are these firms financial innovators that save failing businesses or financial predators that bankrupt otherwise healthy companies and destroy jobs? The first comprehensive examination of this topic, <i>Private Equity at Work</i> provides a detailed yet accessible guide to this controversial business model. Economist Eileen Appelbaum and Professor Rosemary Batt carefully evaluate the evidence—including original case studies and interviews, legal documents, bankruptcy proceedings, media coverage, and existing academic scholarship—to demonstrate the effects of private equity on American businesses and workers. They document that while private equity firms have had positive effects on the operations and growth of small and mid-sized companies and in turning around failing companies, the interventions of private equity more often than not lead to significant negative consequences for many businesses and workers.<p>\n\nPrior research on private equity has focused almost exclusively on the financial performance of private equity funds and the returns to their investors. <i>Private Equity at Work</i> provides a new roadmap to the largely hidden internal operations of these firms, showing how their business strategies disproportionately benefit the partners in private equity firms at the expense of other stakeholders and taxpayers. In the 1980s, leveraged buyouts by private equity firms saw high returns and were widely considered the solution to corporate wastefulness and mismanagement. And since 2000, nearly 11,500 companies—representing almost 8 million employees—have been purchased by private equity firms. As their role in the economy has increased, they have come under fire from labor unions and community advocates who argue that the proliferation of leveraged buyouts destroys jobs, causes wages to stagnate, saddles otherwise healthy companies with debt, and leads to subsidies from taxpayers.\nAppelbaum and Batt show that private equity firms’ financial strategies are designed to extract maximum value from the companies they buy and sell, often to the detriment of those companies and their employees and suppliers. Their risky decisions include buying companies and extracting dividends by loading them with high levels of debt and selling assets. These actions often lead to financial distress and a disproportionate focus on cost-cutting, outsourcing, and wage and benefit losses for workers, especially if they are unionized.<p>\n\nBecause the law views private equity firms as investors rather than employers, private equity owners are not held accountable for their actions in ways that public corporations are. And their actions are not transparent because private equity owned companies are not regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Thus, any debts or costs of bankruptcy incurred fall on businesses owned by private equity and their workers, not the private equity firms that govern them. For employees this often means loss of jobs, health and pension benefits, and retirement income. Appelbaum and Batt conclude with a set of policy recommendations intended to curb the negative effects of private equity while preserving its constructive role in the economy. These include policies to improve transparency and accountability, as well as changes that would reduce the excessive use of financial engineering strategies by firms.<p>\n\nA groundbreaking analysis of a hotly contested business model, <i>Private Equity at Work</i> provides an unprecedented analysis of the little-understood inner workings of private equity and of the effects of leveraged buyouts on American companies and workers. This important new work will be a valuable resource for scholars, policymakers, and the informed public alike. [from publisher web site]\n",

    "DESCRIPTION": "This book explores conflict management in organizations, focusing on the various organizational practices and procedures used to resolve and sometimes prevent conflict in the workplace in countries such as Japan, China, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, Britain, and the United States. It looks at conventional approaches based on standard grievance and dispute resolution procedures as well as alternative dispute resolution methods that seek ways other than civil litigation or turn to administrative agencies that implement employment laws. It discusses grievance procedures under collective bargaining and in non-union firms, along with workplace mediation, interest-based bargaining, the nature and outcomes of conflict management systems, and the role of the organizational ombudsman, third parties, and line managers in conflict management and resolution. In addition, the book examines developments in employment rights and human resources management perspectives on conflict management. It also presents a series of case studies of exemplars and innovators in conflict management, including ‘judicial mediation’ practiced by employment tribunals in the UK. [from publisher web site]",
