/**
 * The ILR Departments have been configured so that we can add departments as needed without a deployment.
 * Here's what you need to do to update this config file:
 * 1. Add another line, following the pattern below.
 * 2. Commit the changes to git and make a pull request
 * 3. Once PR is accepted, copy the file to the /mnt/gfs/home/ilr/config directory on Acquia.
 *    There are several ways to do this, but one easy way is to type the
 *    following command in a terminal window, assuming you first cd to
 *    the directory where you saved your new version of ilr_departments.php.
 *    scp ilr_departments.php ilr@srv-2136.devcloud.hosting.acquia.com:/mnt/gfs/home/ilr/config
